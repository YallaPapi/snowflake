================================================================================
PART 1: BOOK EXTRACTION -- COMPLETE LIST OF DIAGNOSTICS
================================================================================

Blake Snyder's Chapter 7 defines a post-draft "Is It Broken?" test consisting of
NINE (9) diagnostic checks. The chapter's summary (book lines 271-291) explicitly
enumerates all nine. Below is the full extraction with book line references.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOK DIAGNOSTIC 1: "THE HERO LEADS"
Book lines:     37-63
Summary line:   273
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it tests:
    Is the hero proactive? Does the hero drive the action or get dragged
    through the story?

Four sub-checks (all from lines 49-59):
    a) Is the hero's goal clearly stated in the set-up? Is what the hero
       wants obvious? Is it spoken aloud and restated throughout?
    b) Do clues just come to the hero, or does he seek them out? The hero
       cannot be handed his destiny; he must work for it at every step.
    c) Is the hero active or passive? Everything must spring from burning
       desire and deeply held need.
    d) Do other characters tell the hero what to do, or does he tell them?
       "A hero never asks questions" -- count question marks in dialogue;
       there should be few.

How to fix:
    Give the hero a clear goal stated early and restated throughout. Make
    the hero pursue information actively. Reduce question marks in hero
    dialogue.

Examples:
    "Johnny Entropy" -- a detective who shows up, goes through motions,
    never seeks clues, has no goals. (lines 41-45)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOK DIAGNOSTIC 2: "TALKING THE PLOT" / "SHOW DON'T TELL"
Book lines:     65-87
Summary line:   275
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it tests:
    Are characters delivering exposition through unnatural dialogue?
    Are they telling each other things they already know?

Sub-principles:
    a) "Talking the Plot" -- Characters say things like "Well, you're my
       sister, you should know!" or exposition-as-dialogue. Characters
       should serve themselves, not the writer. (lines 65-76)
    b) "Show, Don't Tell" (explicitly called an "adjunct" at line 77) --
       Movies are stories told in pictures. Show a husband eyeing a pretty
       young thing rather than three pages of marriage counseling dialogue.
       Show team pictures on the wall, give a limp from the accident.
       Have characters talk about anything BUT the thing you want to convey.
       (lines 77-87)

How to fix:
    Move exposition out of dialogue into visual action or behavior. Show
    environmental details (team pictures, physical traits). Reveal
    character through action, not words. "Be more concerned with what's
    happening now than what happened before the story started." (line 85)

Key quote:
    "Character is revealed by action taken not by words spoken." (line 85)
    "Show, don't tell" -- identified by name at lines 77, 87.

Examples:
    Husband eyeing a pretty young thing vs. three pages of marriage
    counseling dialogue. Team pictures on the wall, a limp from an
    accident. (lines 77-80)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOK DIAGNOSTIC 3: "MAKE THE BAD GUY BADDER"
Book lines:     89-111
Summary line:   277
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it tests:
    Is the antagonist powerful enough to make the hero look heroic?
    Are hero and antagonist a matched set?

Key principles:
    a) Making the bad guy badder automatically makes the hero bigger.
       (line 97)
    b) Hero and bad guy are "two halves of the same person" -- the mirror
       principle. (lines 103-107)
    c) They must be of equal skill and strength, with the bad guy having
       a slight edge because he is "willing to go to any lengths." (line 109)
    d) Do not make the bad guy impossible to beat -- just a challenge
       that LOOKS impossible. (lines 109-111)

How to fix:
    Ratchet up the antagonist's power and invincibility. Give the edge
    to the bad guy. Ensure hero and antagonist are reflections of each
    other.

Examples:
    James Bond needs Goldfinger/Blofeld/Dr. No, not an evil accountant.
    Batman/Joker (Keaton/Nicholson), Die Hard (Willis/Rickman), Pretty
    Woman (Gere/Alexander) -- hero and villain as mirror images.
    (lines 99-107)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOK DIAGNOSTIC 4: "TURN, TURN, TURN"
Book lines:     113-137
Summary line:   279
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it tests:
    Does the plot ACCELERATE, not just maintain speed? Snyder
    distinguishes velocity (constant speed) from acceleration (increasing
    speed). The plot must go forward faster, with more complexity, to
    the climax. (lines 117-119)

Sub-checks:
    a) New complications must be revealed at every step. (line 129)
    b) More must be revealed about characters -- flaws, treacheries,
       doubts, fears of heroes AND hidden powers, untapped resources,
       dark motivations of bad guys. (lines 129-131)
    c) After the Midpoint, the grip tightens, things happen faster,
       pressure builds to the Act Three climax. (lines 133-134)
    d) "The diamond can not merely move across the screen, it must Turn,
       Turn, Turn in order to truly dazzle us." (lines 131-132)

How to fix:
    Show facets of characters at every step. Expose flaws, treacheries,
    doubts. Reveal hidden powers and dark motivations. Make the plot
    intensify after the Midpoint turn.

Examples:
    "The Cat in the Hat" (Mike Myers) -- tons of kinetic action but no
    forward motion, no stakes, no Turn Turn Turn. (lines 125-128)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOK DIAGNOSTIC 5: "THE EMOTIONAL COLOR WHEEL"
Book lines:     139-159
Summary line:   281-283
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it tests:
    Does the screenplay use the FULL emotional palette, or is it
    emotionally monotone (one-note)?

Emotions explicitly listed by Snyder:
    lust, fear, joy, hope, despair, anger, tenderness, surprise,
    longing, human foible, regret, frustration, near-miss anxiety,
    triumph. (compiled from lines 139-157)

Key technique:
    "Take a scene that's just funny or just dramatic and try to play it
    for one of the missing colors... use the same action, the same +/-,
    the same conflict and result, but play it for lust instead of laughs,
    jealousy instead of flat out stare-down dramatic conflict." (155-157)

How to fix:
    Choose a color for each missing emotion. Tag scenes and change
    emotional tone while keeping the same action and conflict structure.

Examples:
    Farrelly Brothers (Something About Mary, Shallow Hal, Stuck On You)
    -- known for comedy but include scenes of great fear, intense longing,
    lust, human foible. "Every color in the emotional color wheel."
    (lines 147-149)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOK DIAGNOSTIC 6: "HI, HOW ARE YOU? I'M FINE"
Book lines:     161-187
Summary line:   285
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it tests:
    Does every character have unique, differentiated dialogue? Or do all
    characters sound the same (have the writer's voice)?

The Bad Dialogue Test (from Mike Cheda, lines 177-183):
    Cover up the character names on a page of the script. Read the
    dialogue back and forth. Can you tell who is speaking without seeing
    the name? If not, all characters have the writer's voice.

Key principle:
    "In a good script, every character must speak differently. Every
    character must have a unique way of saying even the most mundane
    chat." (lines 183-184)

How to fix:
    Give each character a verbal tic, unique vocabulary, sentence length,
    speech rhythm. Differentiate through how they say things, not just
    what they say.

Examples:
    "Big Ugly Baby" -- one stuttered, one did malapropisms, one was an
    Okie versed in Sartre, alien parents always YELLED with at least
    one CAPITALIZED word per sentence. (lines 185-187)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOK DIAGNOSTIC 7: "TAKE A STEP BACK"
Book lines:     189-208
Summary line:   289
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it tests:
    Does the hero (and ALL characters) start far enough back
    emotionally to show the ENTIRE arc of transformation?

Key principles:
    a) The hero cannot already be the person they're supposed to become.
       They must NEED the journey. (lines 191-193)
    b) "Getting there WAS the story." (line 199)
    c) Applies to ALL characters, not just the hero: "Take A Step Back
       applies to all your characters." (line 201)
    d) "By drawing the bow back to its very quivering end point, the
       flight of the arrow is its strongest, longest, best flight."
       (lines 206-207)

How to fix:
    Take characters back as far as possible emotionally. Show the
    complete flight of the arrow. Show all the change, growth, and
    action of a hero's journey. Apply to every character.

Examples:
    Sheldon & Blake's Golden Fleece about a kid kicked out of military
    school -- the kid was already nice and helpful from the start. Took
    7 drafts to fix because they needed to take him back emotionally.
    (lines 191-199)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOK DIAGNOSTIC 8: "A LIMP AND AN EYE PATCH"
Book lines:     210-231
Summary line:   287
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it tests:
    Does every recurring/minor character have a memorable distinctive
    trait (physical, behavioral, or verbal) so the reader can
    differentiate them?

Key principle:
    "The reader has to have a visual clue, often a running visual
    reminder, that makes remembering them easier." (lines 218-219)

How to fix:
    Assign each recurring character one distinctive physical, behavioral,
    or verbal trait. Reference it whenever the character appears.

Examples:
    "Deadly Mean Girls" -- the lead boy needed a soul-patch and black
    t-shirt. Andy Cohen couldn't identify him across multiple drafts
    until they added these traits. The character "jumped off the page."
    (lines 221-229)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOK DIAGNOSTIC 9: "IS IT PRIMAL?" / "WOULD A CAVEMAN UNDERSTAND?"
Book lines:     233-263
Summary line:   291
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What it tests:
    Are the characters' drives grounded in primal, biological needs?
    Does the story connect with the audience at a caveman level?

Primal drives explicitly listed:
    - Survival
    - Hunger
    - Sex
    - Protection of loved ones
    - Fear of death
    (line 235)

Key principle:
    "At the root of anyone's goal in a movie must be something that
    basic, even if on its surface it seems to be about something else."
    (line 235)
    "At its core it must be about something that resonates at a caveman
    level." (line 262)

How to fix:
    Make each character's desire more primal. Ground everything in
    biological drives. This also makes the story sellable worldwide.

Examples (lines 249-258):
    Die Hard = desire to save one's family
    Home Alone = desire to protect one's home
    Sleepless in Seattle = desire to find a mate
    Gladiator = desire to exact revenge
    Titanic = desire to survive


================================================================================
PART 2: ENGINE IMPLEMENTATION INVENTORY
================================================================================

The engine implements exactly 8 diagnostic checks (not 9).

Hardcoded count locations:
    step_7_prompt.py     line 18:  "Run 8 diagnostic checks"
    step_7_prompt.py     line 23:  "Run ALL 8 diagnostic checks"
    step_7_prompt.py     line 153: "total_checks: 8"
    step_7_prompt.py     line 157: "You MUST run ALL 8 checks"
    step_7_prompt.py     line 161: "total_checks MUST always be 8"
    step_7_prompt.py     line 185: "You MUST run ALL 8 diagnostic checks"
    step_7_validator.py  line 3:   "Validates that all 8 diagnostic checks"
    step_7_validator.py  line 37:  "exactly 8 entries"
    step_7_validator.py  line 58:  "exactly 8 diagnostic check entries"
    step_7_validator.py  line 69:  "len(diagnostics) != 8"
    step_7_validator.py  line 96:  "check_number > 8"
    step_7_diagnostics.py line 27: "8 Blake Snyder Ch.7 diagnostic checks"
    step_7_diagnostics.py line 58: "Run 8 diagnostic checks"
    models.py            line 198: "check_number: int = Field(..., ge=1, le=8)"

Canonical check names (step_7_validator.py lines 15-24):
    1. "The Hero Leads"
    2. "Talking the Plot"
    3. "Make the Bad Guy Badder"
    4. "Turn Turn Turn"
    5. "Emotional Color Wheel"
    6. "Hi How Are You I'm Fine"
    7. "Take a Step Back"
    8. "Limp and Eye Patch"

Engine prompt checks (step_7_prompt.py lines 40-90):
    Each check has: description, fail criteria, fix suggestion.


================================================================================
PART 3: CHECK-BY-CHECK GAP ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Legend:
    MATCH    = Engine correctly implements the book's diagnostic
    PARTIAL  = Engine captures the idea but misses significant details
    MISSING  = Engine does not implement the book's diagnostic at all
    WRONG    = Engine implements something contradicting the book

Severity scale:
    CRITICAL = Structural omission; the engine is provably incomplete
    HIGH     = Significant content missing that changes diagnostic quality
    MEDIUM   = Minor details or examples missing; diagnostic still works
    LOW      = Nuance or emphasis difference; cosmetic

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHECK 1: "THE HERO LEADS"
Status:     MATCH
Severity:   (none -- no issues)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Book requires (4 sub-checks):
    a) Hero's goal clearly stated in set-up             [PRESENT - line 41]
    b) Hero seeks information, not receives passively    [PRESENT - line 41]
    c) Hero directs others, not directed by them         [PRESENT - line 42]
    d) Count question marks in hero dialogue             [PRESENT - line 43]

Engine (step_7_prompt.py lines 40-45):
    "Is the hero PROACTIVE? Does the hero seek information (not receive
    it passively)? Does the hero direct others rather than being directed?
    Count question marks in hero dialogue -- there should be FEW.
    FAIL criteria: Hero is reactive, receives exposition, asks too many
    questions. FIX: Clarify the hero's goal, make the hero pursue
    information actively."

Assessment: All four sub-checks are faithfully represented. The question-mark
counting detail is correctly captured. No gaps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHECK 2: "TALKING THE PLOT" / "SHOW DON'T TELL"
Status:     PARTIAL
Severity:   MEDIUM
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Book requires (2 sub-principles):
    a) "Talking the Plot" -- characters explain things the listener
       already knows through unnatural exposition dialogue.
    b) "Show Don't Tell" (explicitly named as an "adjunct" at line 77) --
       use visual storytelling instead of dialogue. Movies are stories
       told in pictures. Specific techniques: environmental details
       (team pictures on walls), physical traits (a limp from the
       accident), behavioral cues (husband eyeing a pretty young thing).
       Have characters talk about anything BUT the exposition target.

Engine (step_7_prompt.py lines 47-52):
    "Is exposition shown visually or buried in dialogue?
    Bad example: 'Well, you're my sister, you should know!'
    Test: Cover character names -- would anyone say this to someone who
    already knows?
    FAIL criteria: Characters explain things the listener already knows.
    FIX: Move exposition out of dialogue and into visual action or
    behavior."

Gaps found:
    1. "Show Don't Tell" is not named as a distinct sub-principle. The
       engine says "shown visually" which is implicit but does not call
       out the concept by name or give it the weight Snyder does.
    2. The specific TECHNIQUES for showing are absent:
       - Environmental storytelling (team pictures on walls)
       - Physical traits conveying backstory (a limp from the accident)
       - Behavioral substitution (have characters talk about anything
         BUT the thing you want to convey)
       - "Be more concerned with what's happening now than what happened
         before the story started"
    3. Snyder's key quote is not referenced: "Character is revealed by
       action taken not by words spoken" (line 85).

Recommendation:
    Add "Show Don't Tell" as a named sub-principle within this check.
    Add specific visual storytelling techniques to the prompt guidance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHECK 3: "MAKE THE BAD GUY BADDER"
Status:     MATCH
Severity:   (none -- no issues)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Book requires:
    a) Antagonist equal or superior to hero              [PRESENT - line 55]
    b) Mirror principle (two halves of same person)      [PRESENT - line 56]
    c) Bad guy has slight edge -- willing to go further  [PRESENT - line 58]
    d) Don't make bad guy impossible, just looks it      [NOT EXPLICIT]

Engine (step_7_prompt.py lines 54-58):
    "Is the antagonist equal or superior to the hero in power?
    Are hero and antagonist a matched set (mirror principle)?
    FAIL criteria: Antagonist is weaker, not a mirror, or not threatening
    enough. FIX: Give antagonist more power, make them willing to do what
    the hero will not."

Minor note: The nuance "don't make bad guy impossible to beat -- just a
challenge that LOOKS impossible" (line 109-111) is not stated. This is
a subtle but useful coaching point for the AI when generating fixes.
Not severe enough to downgrade from MATCH.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHECK 4: "TURN, TURN, TURN"
Status:     MATCH
Severity:   (none -- no issues, with one LOW note)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Book requires:
    a) Plot accelerates, not just moves forward          [PRESENT - line 61]
    b) New complications at every step                   [PRESENT - line 62]
    c) Reveal more about characters as plot progresses   [NOT EXPLICIT]
    d) After Midpoint, pressure builds to Act Three      [IMPLICIT in 63]

Engine (step_7_prompt.py lines 60-65):
    "Does the plot ACCELERATE (not just maintain speed)?
    Are new complications revealed at every step?
    Does each sequence raise the stakes higher?
    FAIL criteria: Pacing is flat, no escalation, repetitive obstacles.
    FIX: Add complications at each act break, escalate the antagonist's
    actions."

LOW note: Snyder's emphasis on revealing CHARACTER DEPTH as part of the
"turning" (flaws, treacheries, doubts, fears of heroes; hidden powers,
untapped resources, dark motivations of bad guys -- lines 129-131) is
not in the prompt. The engine focuses on plot/pacing escalation, not
character revelation through escalation. This is a missed nuance but
does not constitute a structural gap.

Recommendation:
    Add to the prompt: "Is more revealed about characters (flaws,
    treacheries, hidden powers) at each turning point?"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHECK 5: "EMOTIONAL COLOR WHEEL"
Status:     MATCH
Severity:   (none -- no issues, with one LOW note)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Book requires:
    Full emotional palette. Emotions listed across the chapter:
    lust, fear, joy, hope, despair, anger, tenderness, surprise,
    longing, human foible, regret, frustration, near-miss anxiety,
    triumph. (~14 emotions)

Engine (step_7_prompt.py lines 67-72):
    "Check for: lust, fear, joy, hope, despair, anger, tenderness,
    surprise."
    (8 emotions listed)

LOW note: The engine lists 8 of the ~14 emotions Snyder mentions.
Missing from the prompt: longing, human foible, regret, frustration,
near-miss anxiety, triumph.

Additionally, Snyder's specific recoloring technique is absent from the
prompt: "Take a scene that's just funny and play it for lust instead of
laughs... use the same action, the same +/-, the same conflict and
result" (lines 155-157). This technique could help the AI generate
more specific fix suggestions.

Recommendation:
    Expand the emotion list to include: longing, regret, frustration,
    near-miss anxiety, triumph. Add the recoloring technique to the
    FIX guidance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHECK 6: "HI, HOW ARE YOU? I'M FINE"
Status:     MATCH
Severity:   (none -- no issues)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Book requires:
    Bad Dialogue Test (Mike Cheda): Cover character names, read dialogue,
    determine if characters are distinguishable by speech alone.

Engine (step_7_prompt.py lines 74-78):
    "Does every character speak DIFFERENTLY?
    Test: Cover character names -- can you tell who is speaking from
    dialogue alone?
    FAIL criteria: Characters sound the same, interchangeable dialogue.
    FIX: Differentiate vocabulary, sentence length, and speech rhythm
    per character."

Assessment: The Bad Dialogue Test is correctly captured with its exact
technique. The fix suggestion is practical. No gaps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHECK 7: "TAKE A STEP BACK"
Status:     MATCH
Severity:   (none -- no issues, with one LOW note)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Book requires:
    a) Hero starts as far back as possible emotionally   [IMPLICIT]
    b) Growth must be visible and earned                 [PRESENT - line 82]
    c) Applies to ALL characters, not just the hero      [NOT EXPLICIT]
    d) "Drawing the bow back" metaphor -- distance of
       starting point determines flight of arrow         [NOT IN PROMPT]

Engine (step_7_prompt.py lines 80-84):
    "Is character transformation SHOWN step by step?
    The arc cannot be shortcut -- growth must be visible and earned.
    FAIL criteria: Character changes suddenly without buildup, arc is
    told not shown.
    FIX: Show the starting point clearly, document the process, make
    change visible."

LOW note #1: The engine says "Is character transformation SHOWN step by
step?" which is about showing intermediate steps. Snyder's point is more
about the STARTING POSITION -- how far back the bow is drawn. The engine
does not ask "Does the hero start as far back as possible?" which is the
core question.

LOW note #2: Snyder explicitly states "Take A Step Back applies to ALL
your characters" (line 201). The engine says "character transformation"
without specifying that this applies to supporting characters too.

Recommendation:
    Reframe the primary question as: "Does the hero (and all characters)
    start as far back as possible emotionally?" Add: "Applies to ALL
    characters, not just the protagonist."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHECK 8: "A LIMP AND AN EYE PATCH"
Status:     MATCH
Severity:   (none -- no issues)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Book requires:
    Every recurring character needs a memorable distinctive trait.
    Can be physical, behavioral, or verbal. Gives the reader a visual
    clue / running visual reminder.

Engine (step_7_prompt.py lines 86-90):
    "Does every recurring character have a memorable distinctive trait?
    Can be physical, behavioral, or verbal.
    FAIL criteria: Characters lack distinctive traits, are generic or
    forgettable.
    FIX: Assign each recurring character one distinctive physical,
    behavioral, or verbal trait."

Assessment: Correctly implemented. The "running visual reminder"
concept (referencing the trait each time the character appears) is not
stated but is implied. No significant gaps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHECK 9: "IS IT PRIMAL?" / "WOULD A CAVEMAN UNDERSTAND?"
Status:     MISSING
Severity:   CRITICAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Book requires (lines 233-263, summary line 291):
    Every character's drive must reduce to a primal, biological need.
    Snyder's explicit primal drives:
        - Survival
        - Hunger
        - Sex
        - Protection of loved ones
        - Fear of death

    Key test: "Would a caveman understand?" (line 235)
    Purpose: Verify that story motivations connect at a biological level.
    Also makes the story sellable worldwide (line 236).

    Snyder gives 5 specific film examples mapping plot to primal drive:
        Die Hard        = desire to save one's family
        Home Alone      = desire to protect one's home
        Sleepless...    = desire to find a mate
        Gladiator       = desire to exact revenge
        Titanic         = desire to survive

Engine status:
    COMPLETELY ABSENT from Step 7.
    - Not in step_7_prompt.py (no 9th check defined)
    - Not in step_7_validator.py (REQUIRED_CHECK_NAMES has 8 entries)
    - Not in step_7_diagnostics.py (docstrings say "8 checks")
    - models.py DiagnosticResult constrains check_number to 1-8

    HOWEVER: The PrimalUrge enum EXISTS in models.py (lines 27-33):
        SURVIVAL, HUNGER, SEX, PROTECTION_OF_LOVED_ONES, FEAR_OF_DEATH
    And is used in HeroProfile (line 97): primal_motivation: PrimalUrge

    This means the primal drive concept is defined at Step 3 (Hero
    creation) but is never RE-VERIFIED as a diagnostic at Step 7.
    Snyder's Chapter 7 treats "Is It Primal?" as something to CHECK
    AGAIN during the diagnostic pass, not just something to define
    once. The diagnostic should verify that the primal drives declared
    in Step 3 actually manifest throughout the beat sheet and board
    cards, and that ALL characters (not just the hero) are driven by
    primal motivations.

Files requiring changes to add the 9th diagnostic:
    1. models.py line 198:
       Change: check_number: int = Field(..., ge=1, le=8)
       To:     check_number: int = Field(..., ge=1, le=9)

    2. step_7_validator.py lines 15-24:

       To:     len(diagnostics) != 9

    4. step_7_validator.py line 96:
       Change: check_number > 8
       To:     check_number > 9

    5. step_7_validator.py -- all error messages and fix suggestions

       All instances of "8" in diagnostic count must change to "9"

    7. step_7_prompt.py -- add 9th check definition after line 90:
       9. IS IT PRIMAL?
          - Does every character's drive reduce to a primal need?
          - Primal drives: survival, hunger, sex, protection of loved
            ones, fear of death.
          - Test: "Would a caveman understand this character's goal?"
          - FAIL criteria: Characters motivated by abstract or
            non-primal goals; story does not connect at a biological
            level.
          - FIX: Ground each character's motivation in a primal drive.
            Map the stated goal to one of the five basic drives.

    8. step_7_prompt.py -- add 9th entry to the JSON output format
       example (after line 150)

    9. step_7_diagnostics.py -- update docstrings and comments
       referencing "8 checks" to "9 checks"

PART 4: STRUCTURAL / ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES
================================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUE A: Count Mismatch (8 vs 9)
Severity:   CRITICAL
Files:      ALL Step 7 files + models.py
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The engine hardcodes "8" in 14+ locations across 4 files. The book
explicitly defines 9 diagnostics. This is not a matter of interpretation --
the book's own summary (lines 271-291) enumerates all 9 with "Is it
primal?" as the 9th and final question. The number 8 appears in:

    step_7_prompt.py:     lines 18, 23, 153, 157, 161, 185
    step_7_validator.py:  lines 3, 37, 58, 69, 71, 96, 98-99
    step_7_diagnostics.py: lines 27, 58
    models.py:            line 198

All must be updated to 9.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUE B: "Show Don't Tell" Not Named as Sub-Principle
Severity:   MEDIUM
File:       step_7_prompt.py line 47-52
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Snyder explicitly names "Show, Don't Tell" as an "adjunct" to "Talking
the Plot" (line 77). The engine implicitly captures the concept ("shown
visually") but does not name it or provide the specific visual
storytelling techniques Snyder describes. This reduces the diagnostic's
coaching effectiveness.

Recommendation: Add "Show, Don't Tell" by name to the check description.
Add techniques: environmental details, behavioral cues, talking about
anything BUT the exposition target.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUE C: Timing Mismatch -- Dialogue Checks Before Dialogue Exists
Severity:   HIGH (architectural)
Files:      step_7_diagnostics.py, step_7_prompt.py
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 7 runs BEFORE Step 8 (Screenplay writing). This means diagnostics
that test DIALOGUE quality (checks 2, 6) are being run against scene
descriptions and board cards, not actual screenplay dialogue. Snyder's
diagnostics are designed for a completed first draft.

This is an architectural limitation, not a bug. The engine runs
diagnostics against structural intent (Hero profile, Beat Sheet, Board)
rather than actual screenplay text. This means:

    Check 2 ("Talking the Plot"): Can only check whether the board
    cards DESCRIBE exposition-heavy scenes, not whether actual dialogue
    is guilty of "talking the plot."

    Check 6 ("Hi How Are You I'm Fine"): Cannot apply the Bad Dialogue
    Test (cover names, read dialogue) because no dialogue exists yet.
    The check can only verify that characters are structurally
    differentiated, not that their actual speech is differentiated.

This is not necessarily wrong -- checking structural intent early is
valuable. But the diagnostics should acknowledge this scope limitation,
and ideally a second diagnostic pass should run AFTER Step 8 when
actual dialogue exists.

Recommendation: Either (a) add a note in the prompt that these checks
apply to structural intent at this stage, or (b) add a post-Step-8
diagnostic re-run for dialogue-specific checks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUE D: No Diagnostic Severity Differentiation
Severity:   LOW
Files:      step_7_prompt.py, models.py
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Snyder's diagnostics vary in severity. Some are about fundamental story
structure (Hero Leads, Bad Guy Badder, Turn Turn Turn) while others are
about polish (Limp and Eye Patch, Hi How Are You). The engine treats all
diagnostics identically with a simple pass/fail boolean. There is no
severity classification (e.g., critical/high/medium/low).

The DiagnosticResult model (models.py lines 196-202) has:
    check_number, check_name, passed, problem_details, fix_suggestion

It lacks a severity field. A failed "Hero Leads" check is structurally
more damaging than a failed "Limp and Eye Patch" check, but the engine
cannot distinguish between them.

Recommendation: Add an optional "severity" field to DiagnosticResult:
    severity: str = Field(default="medium", description="critical|high|
    medium|low")

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUE E: Emotion List Incomplete
Severity:   LOW
File:       step_7_prompt.py line 70
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The engine lists 8 emotions: lust, fear, joy, hope, despair, anger,
tenderness, surprise.

Snyder lists approximately 14 across the chapter: lust, fear, joy, hope,
despair, anger, tenderness, surprise, longing, human foible, regret,
frustration, near-miss anxiety, triumph.

Missing from engine: longing, human foible, regret, frustration,
near-miss anxiety, triumph.

This is LOW severity because the 8 listed emotions cover the core
palette. The additional 6 would improve diagnostic precision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUE F: "Take a Step Back" Emphasis Misaligned
Severity:   LOW
File:       step_7_prompt.py lines 80-84
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The engine frames this diagnostic as "Is character transformation SHOWN
step by step?" -- focusing on intermediate visibility. Snyder's actual
point is about the STARTING POSITION: "Take the hero back as far as
possible emotionally." The engine does not ask whether the starting
point is far enough back, which is the core of the diagnostic.

Additionally, Snyder explicitly states this applies to "all your
characters" (line 201). The engine uses generic "character" without
specifying that supporting characters must also be checked.

Recommendation: Change the primary question to: "Does the hero (and ALL
characters) start as far back as possible emotionally?" Add emphasis
on the starting position, not just intermediate steps.


================================================================================
PART 5: ITEMS NOT IN THE BOOK THAT THE ENGINE CHECKS
================================================================================

None found. All 8 implemented diagnostics trace directly to Chapter 7.
The engine does not introduce fabricated diagnostics, invented checks,
or content from other chapters. This is correct behavior.

================================================================================
PART 7: PRIORITY-ORDERED FIX LIST
================================================================================

Priority 1 (CRITICAL):
    Add 9th diagnostic "Is It Primal?" / "Would a Caveman Understand?"
    Update count from 8 to 9 in all 4 files (14+ locations).
    See ISSUE A above and CHECK 9 for complete file-by-file change list.

Priority 2 (HIGH):
    Address timing mismatch for dialogue-dependent diagnostics.
    Either scope the prompt to acknowledge structural-intent-only
    checks, or add a post-Step-8 re-run for checks 2 and 6.

Priority 3 (MEDIUM):
    Enhance Check 2 to name "Show Don't Tell" as a sub-principle
    and add specific visual storytelling techniques.

Priority 4 (LOW):
    - Check 4: Add character-revelation aspect to Turn Turn Turn
    - Check 5: Expand emotion list (add longing, regret, frustration,
      near-miss anxiety, triumph, human foible)
    - Check 7: Reframe as starting-position question; add "all
      characters" scope
    - Add severity field to DiagnosticResult model
