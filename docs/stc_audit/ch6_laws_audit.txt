EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

The engine claims to enforce "8 Immutable Laws of Screenplay Physics" from
Chapter 6 of Blake Snyder's "Save the Cat!" However, Chapter 6 contains
exactly 7 named laws, not 8.

The engine fabricated a law called "Laying Pipe" (listed as law #4) that does
not appear anywhere in Chapter 6. This phantom law propagates through all four
source files and shifts the numbering of every subsequent law.

Of the 7 real laws from the book:
  - 6 are correctly represented (MATCH)
  - 1 has a minor naming deviation (MATCH with note)
  - 0 are partially implemented
  - 0 real laws are missing

There is 1 completely fabricated law that must be removed.

Verdict Tally:
  MATCH:       6
  MATCH/MINOR: 1  (naming prefix deviation)
  PARTIAL:     0
  MISSING:     0
  WRONG:       1  (fabricated "Laying Pipe")

Overall Severity: HIGH -- the fabricated law causes structural count mismatches
throughout the entire pipeline (prompt, validator, model, step executor all
hard-code the number 8).

================================================================================
PART 1: LAWS AS THEY APPEAR IN THE BOOK (Chapter 6)
================================================================================

The chapter presents exactly 7 named laws/rules, in this order:

  1. Save the Cat                  (book lines 31-61)
  2. The Pope in the Pool          (book lines 63-99)
  3. Double Mumbo Jumbo            (book lines 101-141)
  4. Black Vet                     (book lines 143-173)
  5. Watch Out for That Glacier    (book lines 175-201)
  6. The Covenant of the Arc       (book lines 203-239)
  7. Keep the Press Out            (book lines 241-273)

There is NO law called "Laying Pipe" in Chapter 6. The phrase does not appear
in the chapter text at all.

The chapter summary (book lines 275-291) recaps: "Save the Cat, The Pope In
the Pool, Black Vet, and Keep The Press Out" as example law names, and refers
to them collectively as rules learned from watching movies. At no point does
the chapter claim there are 8 laws.

================================================================================
PART 2: LAW-BY-LAW GAP ANALYSIS
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAW 1: SAVE THE CAT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Book Name:       "Save the Cat" (also "Save The Cat" -- Snyder uses both)
Engine Name:     "Save the Cat"
Verdict:         MATCH
Severity:        NONE

BOOK DEFINITION (lines 33-37):
  "The Hero has to do something when we meet him so that we like him and want
  him to win."
  Adjunct: "A screenwriter must be mindful of getting the audience 'in sync'
  with the plight of the Hero from the very start."

BOOK EXAMPLES:
  - Pulp Fiction (lines 37-49): Travolta and Jackson are funny and naive
    discussing McDonald's hamburgers in France. Makes hitmen likeable.
    Anti-hero trick: make the Boss WORSE (threw someone out a window for a
    foot massage), so Travolta looks good by comparison.
  - Aladdin (lines 51-57): Steals food because hungry, chased by guards,
    then gives stolen food to starving kids. Classic STC.
  - Lara Croft (line 59): Negative example -- assumes audience will like
    hero "just cuz."

BOOK TEST FOR VIOLATIONS:
  Does the hero do something likable through ACTION (not told, shown) early
  in the story? For anti-heroes, is their enemy demonstrably worse?

BOOK FIX:
  Add a scene in the Set-Up where the hero demonstrates likability through
  action. For anti-heroes, introduce the antagonist's worse behavior early.

ENGINE IMPLEMENTATION:
  [PROMPT] line 43-44:
    "Hero does something likable early (in Set-Up) to get audience in sync.
    Anti-heroes: make enemy even MORE horrible."
    Check: "Does the Board's Act One (Row 1) include a scene where the hero
    demonstrates likability through ACTION? Not told -- shown."

  [VALIDATOR] line 14: "Save the Cat" in REQUIRED_LAW_NAMES
  [PROMPT] line 79: "Save the Cat" in JSON output template

ANALYSIS:
  The engine captures the core definition accurately, includes the anti-hero
  corollary, and correctly specifies checking Act One for an action-based
  likability scene. The prompt also references the hero's "save_the_cat_moment"
  field from Step 3, which provides the AI evaluator with the specific moment
  to cross-check against the Board.

  No gaps detected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAW 2: THE POPE IN THE POOL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Book Name:       "The Pope In The Pool" (with "The" prefix, lines 63, 79, 83)
Engine Name:     "Pope in the Pool"
Verdict:         MATCH (minor naming note)
Severity:        LOW

BOOK DEFINITION (lines 65-73):
  A technique for burying exposition. Named after "The Plot to Kill the Pope"
  by George Englund. Representatives visit the Pope at the Vatican pool. The
  Pope swims laps in his bathing suit while vital backstory is delivered. The
  audience is distracted by the visual and the exposition goes down painlessly.

BOOK EXAMPLES:
  - The Plot to Kill the Pope (line 73): Pope in bathing suit swimming laps.
  - Drips (lines 81-89): Two plumbers need to pee during a heist explanation;
    pee-inducing visuals distract from exposition.
  - Austin Powers (line 91): Character literally named "Basil Exposition."
  - Pirates of the Caribbean (line 95): Two funny guards deliver Jack
    Sparrow's backstory.
  - A Clear and Present Danger (line 96): Batting cage scene.

BOOK TEST FOR VIOLATIONS:
  Are there scenes that are pure exposition dumps with nothing entertaining
  happening simultaneously?

BOOK FIX:
  Add visual distraction, comedy, or action to any scene that must deliver
  plot information.

ENGINE IMPLEMENTATION:
  [PROMPT] lines 46-47:
    "All exposition buried inside entertaining action/visuals. Never 'talk
    the plot.'"
    Check: "Are there any scenes that are pure exposition dumps? All setup
    information must be delivered while something entertaining is happening."

  [VALIDATOR] line 15: "Pope in the Pool" in REQUIRED_LAW_NAMES
  [PROMPT] line 86: "Pope in the Pool" in JSON output template

ANALYSIS:
  The engine captures the concept correctly. The check is functionally sound.

  Minor naming deviation: The book consistently uses "The Pope In The Pool"
  with the article "The" as a prefix (see lines 63, 79, 83, 89, 93, 97).
  The engine drops "The" and uses just "Pope in the Pool." This means if any
  AI response uses the book's exact phrasing "The Pope in the Pool," the
  validator will reject it as a name mismatch.

  RECOMMENDATION: Either accept both forms or update to "The Pope in the Pool."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAW 3: DOUBLE MUMBO JUMBO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Book Name:       "Double Mumbo Jumbo"
Engine Name:     "Double Mumbo Jumbo"
Verdict:         MATCH
Severity:        NONE

BOOK DEFINITION (lines 101-107):
  "Audiences will only accept one piece of magic per movie. It's The Law."
  "You can not see aliens from outer space land in a UFO and then be bitten
  by a Vampire and now be both aliens and undead."

BOOK EXAMPLES:
  - Spider-Man (lines 111-125): Radioactive spider bite gives Peter powers
    (magic #1) AND a lab accident creates Green Goblin (magic #2). Two
    unrelated sources of supernatural power. Interest wanes at the midpoint
    when the second source of magic appears.
  - Signs (lines 127-141): Aliens landing on Earth (magic #1) AND Mel
    Gibson's crisis of faith in God (magic #2). "God and aliens don't mix"
    -- two different kinds of magic in one movie.

BOOK TEST FOR VIOLATIONS:
  Count the number of distinct supernatural/magical/sci-fi premises. Must be
  at most one.

BOOK FIX:
  Derive all magical elements from a single source. If you have a radioactive
  spider, the villain's powers must come from the same source.

ENGINE IMPLEMENTATION:
  [PROMPT] lines 49-50:
    "Only ONE piece of magic/supernatural per story. Cannot have aliens AND
    vampires."
    Check: "Count how many supernatural/magical/sci-fi elements exist. There
    must be at most ONE."

  [VALIDATOR] line 16: "Double Mumbo Jumbo" in REQUIRED_LAW_NAMES
  [PROMPT] line 93: "Double Mumbo Jumbo" in JSON output template

ANALYSIS:
  Accurately represents the law. The "aliens AND vampires" example is the
  engine's own invention but correctly illustrates the concept (the book's
  actual example is "aliens from outer space land in a UFO and then be bitten
  by a Vampire"). The check logic is correct.

  No gaps detected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAW 4 (ENGINE): "LAYING PIPE" -- FABRICATED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Book Name:       DOES NOT EXIST IN CHAPTER 6
Engine Name:     "Laying Pipe"
Verdict:         WRONG -- FABRICATED LAW
Severity:        CRITICAL

BOOK EVIDENCE:
  The phrase "Laying Pipe" does not appear anywhere in Chapter 6. A full-text
  search of ch6_laws.txt (305 lines) returns zero matches for "lay", "pipe",
  "laying", or "Laying Pipe." The concept is not discussed, referenced, or
  alluded to in any form in this chapter.

  "Laying Pipe" is a general screenwriting colloquialism referring to
  excessive setup/exposition. It may appear elsewhere in screenwriting
  literature, but it is NOT one of Blake Snyder's "Immutable Laws of
  Screenplay Physics" from Chapter 6.

ENGINE IMPLEMENTATION:
  [PROMPT] lines 52-53:
    "Setup/exposition must not exceed ~25% of Act One. Catalyst by page 12-15
    (beat 4)."
    Check: "Is the Catalyst (beat 4) positioned correctly? Is Act One bogged
    down with too much setup before the story starts?"

  [PROMPT] lines 69, 100, 161: "Laying Pipe" in canonical name lists
  [VALIDATOR] line 17: "Laying Pipe" in REQUIRED_LAW_NAMES
  [MODELS] line 187: LawResult allows law_number up to 8 (le=8)

ANALYSIS:
  This law was fabricated to reach a count of 8. Its content -- checking
  Catalyst placement and Act One pacing -- is valid screenwriting guidance
  but belongs to Beat Sheet mechanics (Chapter 4, Step 4), not to the
  Immutable Laws framework of Chapter 6.

  Additionally, this check is REDUNDANT: Step 4 (Beat Sheet) validation
  already verifies Catalyst positioning at beat #4 and correct page targets.
  Having it duplicated here as a fake "Immutable Law" creates confusion
  about where this validation belongs.

  The fabrication has cascading effects:
    - The engine claims "8 Immutable Laws" throughout (prompt line 4, 19, 24,
      41; validator lines 3, 35, 40, 42, 54, 64, 66; step lines 4, 26, 58,
      69)
    - The validator requires exactly 8 law entries (validator line 64)
    - The model allows law_number 1-8 (models line 187)
    - If the AI correctly generates only 7 laws (the real ones), validation
      FAILS because the validator demands exactly 8

  IMPACT: This is a hard blocker. The entire Step 6 pipeline is structurally
  built around an incorrect count of 8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAW 4 (BOOK) / LAW 5 (ENGINE): BLACK VET
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Book Name:       "Black Vet"
Engine Name:     "Black Vet"
Engine Number:   #5 (should be #4)
Verdict:         MATCH (numbering is wrong due to Laying Pipe insertion)
Severity:        MEDIUM (numbering shift)

BOOK DEFINITION (lines 143-173):
  An offshoot of Double Mumbo Jumbo dealing with conceptual creativity.
  "Simple is better. One concept at a time, please. You cannot digest too
  much information, or pile on more to make it better."

  Named after an Albert Brooks Saturday Night Live parody of NBC promos: a
  show called "Black Vet" about a black veterinarian who is also a military
  veteran. Punchline: "He's a veteran and a veterinarian!" The joke is about
  piling too many concepts onto one idea.

BOOK EXAMPLES:
  - Black Vet (Albert Brooks SNL parody, line 153-159): Vet who is also a
    veteran -- two concepts crammed into one show.
  - "Lefty" (lines 163-171): Snyder's own experience. A 1950s blacklisted
    private eye named "Lefty" for political affiliation. Partner wanted to
    also make him left-handed AND an ex-boxer. "Pick one." Too Much Marzipan.

BOOK RELATIONSHIP TO DOUBLE MUMBO JUMBO:
  Line 143: "An offshoot of the Double Mumbo Jumbo rule when dealing with
  conceptual creativity." Black Vet is about concept overload (too many
  ideas piled on), while Double Mumbo Jumbo is about magic-system overload
  (too many supernatural premises). Related but distinct.

BOOK TEST FOR VIOLATIONS:
  Is there more than one high concept competing for attention?

BOOK FIX:
  Strip down to ONE clear hook. Remove extra layers of concept. "Pick one."

ENGINE IMPLEMENTATION:
  [PROMPT] lines 55-56:
    "One high concept per story. Don't pile on multiple concepts."
    Check: "Is there more than one high concept competing for attention? The
    story must have ONE clear hook."

  [VALIDATOR] line 18: "Black Vet" in REQUIRED_LAW_NAMES
  [PROMPT] line 107: "Black Vet" in JSON template (as law #5)

ANALYSIS:
  The engine correctly identifies Black Vet as being about concept overload.
  The check is appropriately simple. The only issue is that the engine
  numbers it as #5 when it should be #4 (because the fabricated "Laying Pipe"
  occupies position #4).

  Once "Laying Pipe" is removed, Black Vet should be renumbered to #4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAW 5 (BOOK) / LAW 6 (ENGINE): WATCH OUT FOR THAT GLACIER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Book Name:       "Watch Out For That Glacier" (line 195-197)
Engine Name:     "Watch Out for That Glacier"
Engine Number:   #6 (should be #5)
Verdict:         MATCH (numbering is wrong due to Laying Pipe insertion)
Severity:        MEDIUM (numbering shift)

BOOK DEFINITION (lines 175-197):
  Danger must be present, imminent, and personal -- not slowly approaching
  from far away. "Danger must be present danger. Stakes must be stakes for
  people we care about. And what might happen to them must be shown from the
  get-go so we know the consequences of the imminent threat."

BOOK EXAMPLES:
  - Dante's Peak (line 183): A volcano slowly about to blow. Audience waits.
  - Outbreak (lines 185-187): Super Ebola virus slowly headed toward the US.
    The "house" is not established until page 75.
  - Open Range (line 189): After a buddy is killed on page 20, Costner and
    Duvall talk about going after the bad guys for an hour and a half.

BOOK TEST FOR VIOLATIONS:
  Is the threat active, personal to the hero, and escalating throughout Act
  Two? Or is it slowly approaching from far away?

BOOK FIX:
  Make danger present and imminent from early on. Show consequences. Make it
  personal to characters we care about.

ENGINE IMPLEMENTATION:
  [PROMPT] lines 58-59:
    "Danger must be present, imminent, and personal -- not slowly approaching."
    Check: "Is the central threat active and personal to the hero throughout
    Act Two? Does it escalate, not just loom?"

  [VALIDATOR] line 19: "Watch Out for That Glacier" in REQUIRED_LAW_NAMES
  [PROMPT] line 114: "Watch Out for That Glacier" in JSON template (as law #6)

ANALYSIS:
  Excellent representation of the law. The "escalate, not just loom" phrasing
  is a good distillation of Snyder's point. The capitalization differs
  slightly from the book ("for" vs "For") but the validator uses the engine's
  canonical form consistently, so this is not a functional issue.

  Once "Laying Pipe" is removed, this should be renumbered to #5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAW 6 (BOOK) / LAW 7 (ENGINE): THE COVENANT OF THE ARC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Book Name:       "The Covenant of the Arc" (with "The" prefix, line 203)
Engine Name:     "Covenant of the Arc"
Engine Number:   #7 (should be #6)
Verdict:         MATCH (minor naming note; numbering wrong)
Severity:        LOW (naming), MEDIUM (numbering shift)

BOOK DEFINITION (lines 203-239):
  "Every single character in your movie must change in the course of your
  story. The only characters who don't change are the Bad Guys."

  Arc definition (line 209): "The change that occurs to any character from
  the beginning, through the middle and to end of each character's 'journey.'"

  "Good guys are those who willingly accept change and see it as a positive
  force. Bad guys are those who refuse to change."

  Snyder's Post-it note on his iMac (line 231): "Everybody arcs."

BOOK EXAMPLES:
  - Pretty Woman (line 217): Richard Gere, Julia Roberts, Laura San Giacomo,
    Hector Elizondo all transform. Only Jason Alexander (bad guy) learns
    exactly zero.

BOOK TEST FOR VIOLATIONS:
  Chart every character's transformation from start to end. Hero must have
  clear arc. Supporting characters must also show change. Bad guy stays static.

BOOK FIX:
  For each character, define opening state and final state. If they are the
  same, the story has not affected that character -- revise.

ENGINE IMPLEMENTATION:
  [PROMPT] lines 61-62:
    "EVERY character must change. Only exception: the bad guy (stays static
    -- that's why they lose)."
    Check: "Does the hero have a clear arc from opening_state to final_state?
    Do supporting characters show change? Does the antagonist remain static?"

  [VALIDATOR] line 20: "Covenant of the Arc" in REQUIRED_LAW_NAMES
  [PROMPT] line 121: "Covenant of the Arc" in JSON template (as law #7)

ANALYSIS:
  The engine captures the law accurately, including the crucial point about
  the bad guy remaining static. The check correctly references the hero
  model's opening_state and final_state fields and asks about supporting
  character arcs.

  Minor naming deviation: The book uses "The Covenant of the Arc" with the
  article "The" (line 203, 223). The engine drops "The." Same issue as with
  "Pope in the Pool."

  Once "Laying Pipe" is removed, this should be renumbered to #6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LAW 7 (BOOK) / LAW 8 (ENGINE): KEEP THE PRESS OUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Book Name:       "Keep The Press Out" (line 249, 263, 273)
Engine Name:     "Keep the Press Out"
Engine Number:   #8 (should be #7)
Verdict:         MATCH (numbering wrong)
Severity:        MEDIUM (numbering shift)

BOOK DEFINITION (lines 241-273):
  Don't bring the media/press/news into your contained story world. Learned
  from Steven Spielberg while developing "Nuclear Family." Bringing the press
  in "blew the reality of the premise." Keeping the story "between them and
  us, the audience" preserves the magic.

BOOK EXAMPLES:
  - E.T. (lines 257-259): No news crews despite a real alien. Spielberg
    deliberately kept it contained to the family and neighborhood.
  - Nuclear Family (lines 249-255): Family gets superpowers. Spielberg
    rejected the idea of media discovering them.
  - Signs (lines 263-269): VIOLATES this law. Mel Gibson watches CNN coverage
    of worldwide alien landings. Makes the situation less desperate because
    "they're no longer alone with this problem."

BOOK EXCEPTION (line 271):
  "Unless it's about the press, unless your movie involves a world-wide
  problem and we follow stories with characters all over the world."

BOOK TEST FOR VIOLATIONS:
  Do any scenes involve media/press/news reporting on the story's events in
  a way that breaks the contained world?

BOOK FIX:
  Remove media scenes unless the story IS about the press.

ENGINE IMPLEMENTATION:
  [PROMPT] lines 64-65:
    "Don't break contained story world with outside media awareness (unless
    story IS about press)."
    Check: "Do any scenes involve the media/press/news reporting on events
    in a way that breaks the story's contained world?"

  [VALIDATOR] line 21: "Keep the Press Out" in REQUIRED_LAW_NAMES
  [PROMPT] line 128: "Keep the Press Out" in JSON template (as law #8)

ANALYSIS:
  Correctly captures the law, including the exception clause. The exception
  for stories that are explicitly about the press matches the book's carve-out
  on line 271.

  Once "Laying Pipe" is removed, this should be renumbered to #7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE S-2: VALIDATOR ONLY CHECKS STRUCTURE, NOT SEMANTICS (MEDIUM)
  The validator (step_6_validator.py) checks:
    - JSON shape (list of 8 dicts)
    - Required fields present (law_number, law_name, passed)
    - Correct types (int, str, bool)
    - Canonical name matching
    - Failed laws have violation_details and fix_suggestion
    - all_passed consistency

  The validator does NOT check:
    - Whether the AI's evaluation of each law actually tests the correct
      concept. For example, if the AI says "Save the Cat: passed=true" but
      gives a rationale about exposition rather than hero likability, the
      validator would still accept it.
    - Whether the violation_details content is semantically related to the
      law being evaluated.
    - Whether the fix_suggestion is actionable or relevant.

  This means the AI could misapply a law's criteria and the validator would
  not catch it. The structural checks are necessary but not sufficient for
  ensuring law-correct evaluation.

  RECOMMENDATION: Add keyword-based semantic checks per law. For example:
    - Save the Cat: violation_details should reference "likab" OR "hero" OR
      "audience" OR "sync" OR "action"
    - Double Mumbo Jumbo: should reference "magic" OR "supernatural" OR
      "one piece"
    - Covenant of the Arc: should reference "change" OR "arc" OR "transform"
  This would catch gross misapplications without being overly restrictive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE S-3: LAW NAME CAPITALIZATION VS BOOK (LOW)
  The book uses the following exact forms:
    "Save The Cat"           (line 33)  or  "Save the Cat" (line 43)
    "The Pope In The Pool"   (line 63, 79, 83)
    "Double Mumbo Jumbo"     (line 101, 107)
    "Black Vet"              (line 143, 151, 169)
    "Watch Out For That Glacier" (the header on lines 175-177 is garbled in
                                  OCR but the rule is stated on line 195-197)
    "The Covenant of the Arc" (line 203, 223)
    "Keep The Press Out"     (line 249, 263, 273)

  The engine uses:
    "Save the Cat"                   -- matches one form in book
    "Pope in the Pool"               -- DROPS "The" prefix
    "Double Mumbo Jumbo"             -- matches book
    "Black Vet"                      -- matches book
    "Watch Out for That Glacier"     -- matches (minor "for" vs "For")
    "Covenant of the Arc"            -- DROPS "The" prefix
    "Keep the Press Out"             -- "the" vs "The" (minor)

  Two law names drop the "The" prefix that the book uses. If AI responses
  follow the book's phrasing, they will fail the canonical name check.

  RECOMMENDATION: Either add "The" to "Pope in the Pool" and "Covenant of
  the Arc" to match the book, or document the deviation and ensure the prompt
  instructs the AI to use the engine's exact canonical names.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE S-4: REDUNDANCY WITH STEP 4 BEAT SHEET VALIDATION (LOW)
  The fabricated "Laying Pipe" law checks Catalyst placement (beat 4, page
  12-15) and Act One pacing. This is already handled by Step 4 (Beat Sheet)
  validation, which checks all 15 beats against their target page positions
  (see models.py lines 274-290, BEAT_PAGE_TARGETS).

  This redundancy disappears when "Laying Pipe" is removed, so no action is
  needed beyond removing the fabricated law.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE S-5: BLACK VET DESCRIBED AS "OFFSHOOT" IN BOOK (INFO)
  The book explicitly states (line 143) that Black Vet is "An offshoot of
  the Double Mumbo Jumbo rule." The engine treats it as a fully independent
  law. This is a reasonable design choice -- Black Vet tests a distinct
  concept (concept overload vs magic-system overload) -- but it is worth
  documenting that the book frames it as a sub-rule of DMJ.

  RECOMMENDATION: No action required. The engine's treatment is defensible.
  Optionally, add a comment in the prompt noting the book's framing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE S-6: REVISION PROMPT ENFORCES FABRICATED LAW (MEDIUM)
  The revision prompt template (step_6_prompt.py line 161) explicitly
  instructs the AI: "You MUST evaluate all 8 laws with exact names: 'Save
  the Cat', 'Pope in the Pool', 'Double Mumbo Jumbo', 'Laying Pipe', 'Black
  Vet', 'Watch Out for That Glacier', 'Covenant of the Arc', 'Keep the
  Press Out'."

  This means even if the AI's initial response correctly identifies only 7
  laws, the revision prompt will force it to add the fabricated "Laying Pipe"
  law in its corrected output.

  FILE: src\screenplay_engine\pipeline\prompts\step_6_prompt.py
  LINE: 161
  FIX: Remove "Laying Pipe" from the list; change "all 8 laws" to "all 7
  laws."

================================================================================
PART 4: SUMMARY OF ALL FINDINGS BY SEVERITY
================================================================================

CRITICAL (must fix before engine is book-accurate):
  [C-1] "Laying Pipe" is fabricated -- not in Chapter 6
        Files: prompt (lines 52-53, 69, 100-104, 161), validator (line 17),
               models (line 187), step (lines 4, 26, 58, 69)
        Fix: Remove "Laying Pipe" entirely; change all counts from 8 to 7;
             renumber remaining laws 4-7.

MEDIUM (affects correctness/robustness):
  [M-1] All law numbers after #3 are shifted by +1 due to Laying Pipe
        insertion. Black Vet is #5 (should be #4), Glacier is #6 (should
        be #5), Covenant is #7 (should be #6), Press is #8 (should be #7).
        Fix: Resolved automatically when C-1 is fixed.

  [M-2] Revision prompt (line 161) forces AI to include fabricated law.
        Fix: Resolved automatically when C-1 is fixed.

  [M-3] Validator only checks structure, not semantic correctness of law
        evaluations.
        Fix: Add keyword-based semantic spot-checks per law.

LOW (cosmetic/best-practice):
  [L-1] "Pope in the Pool" and "Covenant of the Arc" are missing the "The"
        prefix that the book uses.
        Fix: Add "The" prefix or document the deviation.

  [L-2] Book frames Black Vet as an "offshoot" of Double Mumbo Jumbo; engine
        treats it as independent.
        Fix: None required. Optionally document.

INFORMATIONAL:
  [I-1] The chapter summary (book lines 287) lists only four law names as
        examples ("Save the Cat, The Pope In the Pool, Black Vet, and Keep
        The Press Out"), omitting three others. This does not affect the
        engine -- all 7 laws are clearly presented in the chapter body.

================================================================================
PART 5: RECOMMENDED FIX PLAN
================================================================================

Priority 1 (Critical -- C-1):
  1. In step_6_prompt.py:
     a. Remove lines 52-53 (Laying Pipe definition and check)
     b. Renumber laws 5-8 to 4-7 in the USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE
     c. Remove lines 98-104 (Laying Pipe JSON template entry)
     d. Renumber laws 5-8 to 4-7 in the JSON template
     e. Change all "8" references to "7" (lines 4, 19, 24, 41, 68, 161)
     f. Remove "Laying Pipe" from canonical name lists (lines 69, 161)

  2. In step_6_validator.py:
     a. Remove "Laying Pipe" from REQUIRED_LAW_NAMES (line 17)
     b. Change all "8" references to "7" (lines 3, 35, 40, 42, 54, 64, 66,
        86, 89, 198, 248)
     c. Remove "Laying Pipe" from fix suggestion strings (lines 219-222,
        252-255)

  3. In step_6_immutable_laws.py:
     a. Change all "8" references to "7" (lines 4, 26, 58, 69)

  4. In models.py:
     a. Change LawResult.law_number constraint from le=8 to le=7 (line 187)

Priority 2 (Medium -- M-3):
  5. In step_6_validator.py:
     a. Add semantic keyword checks in the per-law validation loop
     b. For each law, verify that violation_details or pass rationale
        contains at least one keyword related to the law's actual concept

Priority 3 (Low -- L-1):
  6. In step_6_prompt.py and step_6_validator.py:
     a. Decide whether to add "The" prefix to "Pope in the Pool" and
        "Covenant of the Arc" to match the book exactly
     b. Update all references consistently across both files

================================================================================
PART 6: CORRECT LAW MAPPING (for reference after fixes)
================================================================================

After removing "Laying Pipe," the correct law numbering should be:

  Law #  | Name                         | Book Lines | Engine Check Focus
  -------|------------------------------|------------|---------------------------
  1      | Save the Cat                 | 31-61      | Hero likability via ACTION
  2      | The Pope in the Pool         | 63-99      | Exposition buried in action
  3      | Double Mumbo Jumbo           | 101-141    | Max 1 magic system
  4      | Black Vet                    | 143-173    | Max 1 high concept
  5      | Watch Out for That Glacier   | 175-201    | Danger is present/personal
  6      | The Covenant of the Arc      | 203-239    | Every character changes
  7      | Keep the Press Out           | 241-273    | No media breaking world

  Total: 7 laws (matching the book exactly)
