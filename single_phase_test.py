    A quantum physicist discovers that her consciousness can split across parallel universes

    selves and bring knowledge back, she must decide whether to use this power to fix

TASK: Create the complete story foundation including:
1. ConceptMaster: Step 0 concept analysis (genre, audience, themes, delight factors)  
2. StoryArchitect: Step 1 logline (one compelling sentence, 25 words max)
3. StoryArchitect: Step 2 paragraph summary (5 sentences with clear disasters)

Work together systematically. ConceptMaster should establish the foundation, then StoryArchitect should build the structural elements.
