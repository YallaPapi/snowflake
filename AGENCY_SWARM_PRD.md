# Agency Swarm Novel Generation System - PRD

## üéØ Executive Summary

Transform the current linear Snowflake Method pipeline into a revolutionary **collaborative AI agent ecosystem** using the Agency Swarm framework. This will create the world's first AI "publishing house" where specialized agents collaborate, critique, and refine each other's work to generate professional-quality novels.

## üìã Current State Analysis

### Existing System (Linear Pipeline)
```
Step 0 ‚Üí Step 1 ‚Üí Step 2 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Step 10 ‚Üí Novel
```

**Limitations:**
- **Rigid sequence**: No feedback loops or revision cycles
- **Single-threaded**: Cannot leverage parallel processing
- **No collaboration**: Each step operates in isolation
- **Limited creativity**: No cross-pollination of ideas
- **Quality bottlenecks**: Single-point validation failures

**Strengths to Preserve:**
- ‚úÖ **100% functional** Snowflake Method implementation
- ‚úÖ **Complete validation** system with quality gates
- ‚úÖ **Professional export** formats (Markdown, DOCX, EPUB)
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive observability** and monitoring
- ‚úÖ **35+ successful** novel projects generated

## üöÄ Vision: Agency Swarm Transformation

## üîÑ Communication Flow Design

### Primary Communication Patterns

1. **Linear Flow** (Main storyline development):
   ```
   ConceptMaster ‚Üí LoglineMaster ‚Üí StoryArchitect ‚Üí ScenePlanner ‚Üí ProseWriter
   ```

2. **Character Integration** (Character development):
   ```
   CharacterCreator ‚Üê‚Üí StoryArchitect
   CharacterCreator ‚Üê‚Üí DialogueSpecialist
   CharacterCreator ‚Üí ProseWriter
   ```

3. **Quality Loops** (Feedback and improvement):
   ```
   All Agents ‚Üí EditorAgent ‚Üí Revision Requests
   All Agents ‚Üí CriticAgent ‚Üí Creative Feedback  
   All Outputs ‚Üí QualityAssessor ‚Üí Approval/Rejection
   ```

4. **Specialized Consultations**:
   ```
   Any Agent ‚Üê‚Üí TensionMaster (for dramatic enhancement)
   Any Agent ‚Üê‚Üí DialogueSpecialist (for voice issues)
   ```

5. **Orchestration** (Management and coordination):
   ```
   NovelDirector ‚Üí All Agents (project management)
   All Agents ‚Üí NovelDirector (status updates)
   ```

### Communication Rules
