# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Graphic Novel Extension for Snowflake Engine

## 1. Comic Book Industry Research

### Comic Script Formats
- **Full Script (DC Style)**: The writer specifies page and panel breakdowns, descriptions, and all dialogue/captions for each panel. This method provides maximum detail and control for artists and letterers.[1][2][3]
- **Marvel Method**: Writer supplies a plot outline. Artist draws the pages, and the writer adds dialogue/captions after the fact. This allows greater artistic freedom but requires tight collaboration between writer and artist.[4][5][2][1]
- **DC Style**: Essentially the Full Script method, emphasizing panel-by-panel breakdown, typically used by DC Comics.[2][1]
- **Industry Example**: A script page typically formats as:
  ```
  Page 1 (5 panels)
  Panel 1: Description...
    Character (CAPTION): "Dialogue here."
    Character (BALLOON): "Talk bubble here."
  Panel 2: ...
  ```

### Panel Composition Best Practices
- **Panel Count per Page**: Standard is 5–7 panels per page. Up to 9 for detailed pages, but more than 9 risks overcrowding.[6]
- **Panel Sizing & Flow**: Vary panel size for pacing—large panels for drama, small panels for rapid action. Creative and consistent gutters (spacing) enhance flow and clarity.[7][8]
- **Visual Flow**: Use leading lines, character gaze, body language, and panel arrangement to guide reader's eye in the proper sequence.[8][7]
- **Page Layout & Pacing**: Rhythm is driven by panel size and placement. Important beats or reveals are often reserved for full-page splashes or dramatic page turns.[9][8]

### Visual Storytelling Principles
- **Showing vs Telling**: Favor actions and visual cues over exposition. Limit narration; rely on imagery for mood and plot.[10]
- **Visual Beats**: Each panel should capture a specific moment ("beat"). Moment-to-moment actions are reserved for tension or drama, action-to-action is used for sequences.[11][10]
- **Types of Panel Transitions** (per Scott McCloud): 
  - Moment-to-Moment
  - Action-to-Action
  - Subject-to-Subject
  - Scene-to-Scene
  - Aspect-to-Aspect
  - Non-Sequitur[9][11]

### Dialogue Formatting Standards
- **Balloon Placement**: Letterers and artists coordinate to ensure balloons do not cover faces/action. Balloons usually placed top-to-bottom, left-to-right for natural reading order.[3][6]
- **Word Count Limits**: No more than 50 words per panel, and usually 20–35 per balloon to avoid visual clutter.[6]
- **Formatting**: Character names above the dialogue line; no quotation marks or brackets to streamline letterer workflows.[12][3]

### Art Direction Terminology
- Consistent use of terms like:
  - Close-up, Medium shot, Wide shot
  - Foreground/Background
  - Off-panel/On-panel
  - SFX (Sound Effects)
  - CAPTION, BALLOON[13][3]

### Industry Tools & Workflows
- **Popular writing tools**: Final Draft, Scrivener, Celtx, Comics Experience script templates.[3][12]
- **Art & Lettering tools**: Clip Studio Paint, Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator, Procreate, Affinity Designer.

## 2. Technical Requirements

### Prose-to-Panel Conversion
- **Breaking Paragraphs**: Each paragraph is parsed for discrete actions or beats, which map to panels. Each panel represents a visually distinct moment or exchange, typically one major action or dialogue exchange per panel.[14][10]
- **Guidelines**: Avoid multiple emotional beats in a panel. Limit to one expressive change/action per panel for clarity.[10]

### Character Design Consistency
- **Character Design Sheets**: Include full-body poses, multiple angles, facial expression ranges, color palettes, personality blurb, and standout features for each character to ensure consistency across panels and artists.[15][16]

### Visual Scene Direction Standards
- **Descriptions**: For every panel, specify setting, lighting, character positions, and emotional context. Use concise, visual-first direction.[13][3]

### Panel Transition Types
- Encode transition type for each panel as metadata:
  - Moment-to-Moment (small changes, slow pacing)
  - Action-to-Action (shows motion steps)
  - Scene-to-Scene (location/time change)
  - Subject-to-Subject, etc.[11][9]

### Page Turn Timing
- **Page Reveals**: Use the last panel on a right-hand page (often even numbered) for major reveals/twists, taking advantage of the natural dramatic effect of turning the page.[8][9]
- **Guidance**: Insert metadata/tag for intended dramatic page turns.

## 3. Format Specifications

### Script Formatting
- **Panel Description Structure**:
  ```
  PAGE [number] (X panels)
  PANEL [number]: [Description]
    [Character]: (BALLOON) "Dialogue"
    [Character]: (CAPTION) "Caption narration"
    SFX: "Sound Effect"
  ```
- **Panel Descriptions**: Start with panel number and a concise, vivid description of visuals.[1][13][3]
- **Downloadable Script Templates**: Official templates available via Comics Experience, Fred Van Lente’s format, and other professional comic scripting resources.[12][13][3]

### Character Design Sheet Requirements
- Include: full-body, turnarounds (front, back, side), 4–8 facial expressions, scale comparison, signature items, and a short character bio.[16][15]

### Art Direction Annotation
- Use comment tags for specific visual instructions, e.g.:
  - [ARTIST NOTE]: "Emphasize character’s emotions here."
  - [COLORIST]: "Nighttime mood, cool blues."
- Avoid excessive art direction—trust the artist but ensure critical elements are clear.[13][3][12]

## 4. Quality Gates

### Validating Visual Storytelling Flow
- **Automated Checks**: 
  - Each panel should be a single coherent moment/beat.
  - Progression between panels should be logical and smooth (scene/subject/moment-to-moment transitions).[10][11]
- **Manual Review**: Editor review for visual clarity and narrative flow.

### Panel Count and Dialogue Density Guidelines
- **Panels Per Page**: 5–7 standard; max 9 panels for dense scenes. Minimize overuse of high-density pages to avoid clutter.[6][8]
- **Dialogue Density**: Max 50 words per panel, preferably less. Max 20–35 per speech balloon. No more than 2–3 balloons per panel unless for group scenes.[6]

### Visual Continuity Checks
- Character appearances/checks against design sheet.[15][16]
- Environmental consistency across sequences.
- Prop and costume continuity validated against previous panels.
