    A satirical near-future novel where people can trade chunks of their lifespan like currency.
    The world has commodified time itself - you can sell years of your life for immediate cash,
    buy someone else's decades for longevity, or use lifespan as collateral for loans.
    Corporate life-harvesting, biological capitalism, and time-debt collection agencies rule society.

    Fresh college graduate Casey Chen, drowning in student debt and facing eviction,
    stumbles into a sketchy pawn shop called LifeHock and accidentally sells 10 years
    of their lifespan for quick cash. What seemed like easy money becomes a nightmare
    when Casey realizes the true horror of losing a decade. Now they must navigate
    the absurd underground economy of life-brokers, time-repo agents, and biological
    debt collectors in a desperate chase to buy back their stolen years before it's too late.
