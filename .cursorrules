## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The Snowflake Method novel writing system implements specialized logic across three core areas:

### Pipeline Orchestration (Importance: 95)
Coordinates the 11-step novel development process through:
- Step dependencies and validation 
- Artifact versioning with upstream hash tracking
- Automated regeneration of dependent components
- Story structure integrity enforcement

Key files:
- `src/pipeline/orchestrator.py`
- `src/pipeline/steps/step_0_first_things_first.py`
- `src/pipeline/steps/step_10_draft_writer.py`

### Validation Framework (Importance: 90)
Enforces domain-specific rules for:
- Story market positioning and trope validation
- Scene structure with mandatory conflicts
- Character development and arc alignment
- Moral premise integration
- Scene triad organization (Goal/Conflict/Setback patterns)

Key files:
- `src/pipeline/validators/step_0_validator.py`
- `src/pipeline/validators/step_3_validator.py`
- `src/pipeline/validators/step_8_validator.py`

### AI Content Generation (Importance: 85)
Manages creative text generation through:
- Scene-specific prompt engineering
- POV consistency enforcement
- Character voice maintenance  
- Word count and pacing controls
- Scene hook validation

Key files:
- `src/ai/generator.py`
- `src/pipeline/prompts/step_0_prompt.py`

The system provides end-to-end novel creation following strict methodological rules, with validation at each step ensuring adherence to professional writing principles and story structure requirements.
