Snowflake Step 2 — ONE-PARAGRAPH SUMMARY (Five Sentences)
=========================================================
    PURPOSE
    -------
    Expand the logline into EXACTLY FIVE SENTENCES to establish a robust three-act structure with THREE DISASTERS and a clear MORAL PREMISE pivot.
    This paragraph is the backbone. Everything later must trace back to one of these sentences.

    REQUIRED SENTENCE MAP (DO NOT CHANGE)
    -------------------------------------
    1) Setup: time/place + lead(s) + why the goal matters RIGHT NOW.
    2) DISASTER #1 (end of Act I): an event that FORCES commitment; walking away becomes impossible.
    3) DISASTER #2 (end of Act IIa): a blow that drives the FALSE → TRUE belief shift (moral premise); the lead changes tactics.
    4) DISASTER #3 (end of Act IIb): a blow that FORCES both lead (and villain) to commit to ENDING the story.
    5) Act III: showdown + immediate outcome (happy/sad/bittersweet).

    MORAL PREMISE (WRITE IT LITERALLY)
    ----------------------------------
    - Template: "People succeed when they [TRUE BELIEF], and they fail when they [FALSE BELIEF]."
    - Sentence 3 must SHOW the pivot from false to true.

    OUTPUT ARTIFACTS
    ----------------
    - S2_PARAGRAPH: "<five sentences, exactly>"
    - MORAL_PREMISE: "<one sentence>"

    DO EXACTLY THIS
    ---------------
    1) Copy the logline’s lead(s) and goal into Sentence 1. Add a concrete setting cue and a time pressure cue.
    2) Brainstorm 6–10 possible big hits. Choose the THREE that best escalate cost and compress options. Assign them to D1, D2, D3.
    3) Write Sentence 2 so D1 removes retreat options. Use "forces" language.
    4) Write Sentence 3 so D2 strikes the character’s values/identity and triggers a new strategy (the moral pivot). Make this explicit.
    5) Write Sentence 4 so D3 narrows the path to ONE endgame. No subplots hijack the throughline.
    6) Write Sentence 5 with the showdown type and immediate emotional landing (no epilogue fluff).
    7) Read the paragraph end-to-end. Convert any coincidence into causality or delete it.

    PRACTICAL HINTS (IN THE BOOK’S SPIRIT, PARAPHRASED)
    ---------------------------------------------------
    - D1 = “burn the ships”: after it, backing out would be cowardly, impossible, or catastrophic.
    - D2 = worldview collision: the old way fails; a new belief must drive a new tactic.
    - D3 = point of no return to the endgame: the final confrontation is inevitable.

    ACCEPTANCE CHECKS
    -----------------
    - Exactly five sentences (not four, not six).
    - D1/D2/D3 are named or clearly embedded and are forcing functions.
    - Sentence 3 shows the moral pivot explicitly.
    - Sentence 5 states the ending type cleanly.

    FAILURE MODES → FIXES
    ---------------------
    - Missing middle disaster: add a cost that forces a BEHAVIOR change (new approach).
    - Spectacle disaster: ensure it CHANGES THE SITUATION and removes options.
    - Mushy ending: say “wins the case”, “loses the race”, or “chooses to walk away” — be concrete.

    WARNINGS — DO NOT DEVIATE
- Follow the Snowflake order. If a better idea appears later, revise the upstream artifact FIRST, then regenerate downstream artifacts.
- Use plain, literal language in planning artifacts. No flowery prose, no metaphors. Save flourish for Step 10 drafting.
- Fill every required field. If unknown, write BEST-GUESS and mark TODO. Do not leave blanks.
- Never skip the MORAL PREMISE (Step 2) or the CONFLICT requirement (Steps 8–9). These are non-negotiable.


    STANDARD REGENERATION PROTOCOL (ALWAYS THE SAME)
1) Identify smallest upstream artifact that is insufficient or contradictory.
2) Regenerate ONLY that artifact. Snapshot the prior version with a timestamped filename.
3) Re-run the validator for that artifact. Fix until it passes.
4) Propagate forward: regenerate all directly dependent artifacts in order.
5) Record a one-sentence change log, e.g., "Moved D2 from train crash to courtroom ambush; adjusted POV in chs 19–22."


    DONE WHEN
    ---------
    You have a crisp five-sentence paragraph plus one moral premise line, both stored as text and referenced by ID.
