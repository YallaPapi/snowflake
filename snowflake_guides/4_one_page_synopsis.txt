Snowflake Step 4 — ONE-PAGE SYNOPSIS (~500–700 words)
=====================================================
    PURPOSE
    -------
    Expand Step 2’s five sentences into FIVE PARAGRAPHS — exactly one paragraph per sentence — to create a clear causal plan.
    This is internal. Clarity over style.

    OUTPUT ARTIFACT
    ---------------
    one_page_synopsis.md — five paragraphs, ~500–700 words total.

    DO EXACTLY THIS
    ---------------
    1) Para 1 from Sentence 1: open on the situation and why the goal matters now. Identify the first visible step toward the goal.
    2) Para 2 from Sentence 2 (D1): dramatize the event that FORCES commitment. Explicitly state why retreat is now impossible.
    3) Para 3 from Sentence 3 (D2): show the values/identity hit and the pivot to a NEW tactic (tie to the moral premise).
    4) Para 4 from Sentence 4 (D3): stack pressures so retreat options collapse. Name the bottleneck to the endgame.
    5) Para 5 from Sentence 5: stage the showdown beats, the immediate outcome, and the emotional landing.
    6) Ensure cause→effect across paragraphs. Replace coincidences with set-ups.
    7) Keep minor names to a minimum; use role labels.

    MINI EXAMPLE OUTLINE (FORMAT ONLY)
    ----------------------------------
    - P1: A chef’s diner faces foreclosure; the grant application opens in 10 days.
    - P2 (D1): Rival sabotages her tasting; she commits to competing anyway — there is no other funding path.
    - P3 (D2): She loses her sous-chef; realizes her control belief is false; recruits help and changes tactics.
    - P4 (D3): Health inspector shuts her down on semifinals day; only one path remains — win finals with a pop-up kitchen.
    - P5: She wins, saves the diner, and chooses partnership over solo control.

    ACCEPTANCE CHECKS
    -----------------
    - Exactly FIVE paragraphs mapping 1:1 to Step 2 sentences.
    - D1/D2/D3 paragraphs contain a clear FORCING FUNCTION.
    - The moral pivot is visible in paragraph 3.

    FAILURE MODES → FIXES
    ---------------------
    - New subplot steals the spine: move it to Step 6 or revise Step 2 first.
    - D-paragraphs read like notes: add the “no way back because …” line.
    - Vague ending: make the outcome observable, not thematic.

    WARNINGS — DO NOT DEVIATE
- Follow the Snowflake order. If a better idea appears later, revise the upstream artifact FIRST, then regenerate downstream artifacts.
- Use plain, literal language in planning artifacts. No flowery prose, no metaphors. Save flourish for Step 10 drafting.
- Fill every required field. If unknown, write BEST-GUESS and mark TODO. Do not leave blanks.
- Never skip the MORAL PREMISE (Step 2) or the CONFLICT requirement (Steps 8–9). These are non-negotiable.


    STANDARD REGENERATION PROTOCOL (ALWAYS THE SAME)
1) Identify smallest upstream artifact that is insufficient or contradictory.
2) Regenerate ONLY that artifact. Snapshot the prior version with a timestamped filename.
3) Re-run the validator for that artifact. Fix until it passes.
4) Propagate forward: regenerate all directly dependent artifacts in order.
5) Record a one-sentence change log, e.g., "Moved D2 from train crash to courtroom ambush; adjusted POV in chs 19–22."


    DONE WHEN
    ---------
    Five causal paragraphs exist and match Step 2 sentence-for-paragraph mapping.
