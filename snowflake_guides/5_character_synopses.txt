Snowflake Step 5 — CHARACTER SYNOPSES (½–1 page each)
=====================================================
    PURPOSE
    -------
    Write ½–1 page per principal covering backstory, role in plot, and psychology so their choices feel inevitable and readable from inside their POV.
    Emphasize the antagonist’s interiority.

    OUTPUT ARTIFACT
    ---------------
    character_synopses.json — list of objects with: id, backstory, plot_role, psychology, disaster_links[], voice_notes[]

    DO EXACTLY THIS
    ---------------
    1) BACKSTORY: write only the causal history that drives present behavior (wounds, pride, crucial relationships).
    2) PLOT ROLE: explain how this character intersects the protagonist’s goal and the three disasters (shove/pull moments).
    3) PSYCHOLOGY: state current belief, fear, desire; predict their default reaction under stress.
    4) VILLAIN (special): write empathetically, as if they are the hero of their own story with a valid logic chain.
    5) VOICE NOTES: capture diction (formal/casual), rhythm (clipped/rambling), and a habitual body-language tell.
    6) LINK explicitly to the scene pressure that points at D1/D2/D3.

    LITERAL TEMPLATE
    ----------------
    ```
    id: <char_id>
    backstory: <½ page>
    plot_role: <½ page>
    psychology:
      belief_false: <...>
      belief_true: <...>
      fear: <...>
      desire: <...>
    disaster_links: [ "pushes D1 via <event>", "complicates D2 by <event>", "forces D3 by <event>" ]
    voice_notes: [ "clipped sentences", "never swears", "stares at the floor when lying" ]
    ```

    ACCEPTANCE CHECKS
    -----------------
    - Each principal has all sections filled.
    - Antagonist has coherent worldview; not “evil for evil’s sake.”
    - At least one explicit disaster link per principal.

    FAILURE MODES → FIXES
    ---------------------
    - Backstory dump: cut everything that doesn’t alter present choices.
    - Vague psych: translate into behavior the reader will see.
    - No disaster link: add a concrete shove/pull beat.

    WARNINGS — DO NOT DEVIATE
- Follow the Snowflake order. If a better idea appears later, revise the upstream artifact FIRST, then regenerate downstream artifacts.
- Use plain, literal language in planning artifacts. No flowery prose, no metaphors. Save flourish for Step 10 drafting.
- Fill every required field. If unknown, write BEST-GUESS and mark TODO. Do not leave blanks.
- Never skip the MORAL PREMISE (Step 2) or the CONFLICT requirement (Steps 8–9). These are non-negotiable.


    STANDARD REGENERATION PROTOCOL (ALWAYS THE SAME)
1) Identify smallest upstream artifact that is insufficient or contradictory.
2) Regenerate ONLY that artifact. Snapshot the prior version with a timestamped filename.
3) Re-run the validator for that artifact. Fix until it passes.
4) Propagate forward: regenerate all directly dependent artifacts in order.
5) Record a one-sentence change log, e.g., "Moved D2 from train crash to courtroom ambush; adjusted POV in chs 19–22."


    DONE WHEN
    ---------
    Every principal has a ½–1 page synopsis with explicit links to the spine and usable voice notes.
