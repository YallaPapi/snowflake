Snowflake Step 0 — FIRST THINGS FIRST (Pre-Step)
================================================
    PURPOSE
    -------
    Lock the STORY MARKET POSITION before any plotting. Name the Category/Genre, the Kind of Story, and the Audience-Delight reason.
    This prevents later drift and sets the tone, tropes, and length expectations you must satisfy.

    INPUTS YOU MUST COLLECT (LITERAL FIELDS)
    ----------------------------------------
    - Category/Genre: a bookstore shelf label readers recognize. Examples: "Romantic Suspense", "Epic Fantasy", "Domestic Thriller", "Cozy Mystery".
    - Kind of Story: one sentence stating the central promise in trope language. Examples: "Enemies-to-lovers with espionage backdrop." / "Closed-room whodunit aboard a sleeper train."
    - Audience Delight: one sentence listing 3–5 satisfiers (tropes, tones, endings) that this audience craves and this story will deliver.

    OUTPUT ARTIFACT (STORE EXACTLY THESE FIELDS AS JSON OR YAML)
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    {
      "category": "<market label>",
      "story_kind": "<one sentence promise with trope signal>",
      "audience_delight": "<one sentence naming concrete satisfiers>"
    }

    DO EXACTLY THIS (STEP-BY-STEP)
    ------------------------------
    1) Write Category as a market label people can find on a retailer. DO NOT invent a hybrid here.
    2) Write Kind of Story in one sentence. Include at least one trope noun (e.g., "enemies-to-lovers", "mentor betrayal", "heist that goes wrong").
    3) Write Audience Delight in one sentence. Use concrete satisfiers, not vibes. Example components: "slow-burn tension", "competence porn", "twist ending", "grumpy/sunshine dynamic", "closed-room puzzle".
    4) Read all three aloud. Convert adjectives to nouns where possible. Keep the promise compact.
    5) Freeze the artifact. If future steps collide with this, RETURN here, update, then regenerate downstream.

    EXAMPLES (PARAPHRASED IN THE STYLE OF THE BOOK)
    -----------------------------------------------
    EX1 — Upmarket WF: Category: "Contemporary Women's Fiction" / Kind: "A perfectionist must finish the book that terrifies her." / Delight: "Relatable creative struggle, complicated friendships, cathartic career win."
    EX2 — Thriller-Romance: Category: "Romantic Suspense" / Kind: "Enemies-to-lovers against an espionage conspiracy." / Delight: "Undercover reveals, forced proximity, betrayal twist, heroic sacrifice ending."

    ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST (ALL MUST PASS)
    ------------------------------------
    - Category is a REAL shelf label.
    - Kind of Story is ONE sentence with a trope noun.
    - Audience Delight lists CONCRETE satisfiers (3–5 items).

    FAILURE MODES → FIXES
    ---------------------
    - Vague category ("Literary"): add a sales qualifier ("Upmarket Family Drama").
    - Kind-of-story sneaks in clauses: split, keep only the promise clause.
    - Audience-delight uses mood words only: replace with named payoffs (twist, reveal, puzzle, slow-burn, redemption arc).

    WARNINGS — DO NOT DEVIATE
- Follow the Snowflake order. If a better idea appears later, revise the upstream artifact FIRST, then regenerate downstream artifacts.
- Use plain, literal language in planning artifacts. No flowery prose, no metaphors. Save flourish for Step 10 drafting.
- Fill every required field. If unknown, write BEST-GUESS and mark TODO. Do not leave blanks.
- Never skip the MORAL PREMISE (Step 2) or the CONFLICT requirement (Steps 8–9). These are non-negotiable.


    STANDARD REGENERATION PROTOCOL (ALWAYS THE SAME)
1) Identify smallest upstream artifact that is insufficient or contradictory.
2) Regenerate ONLY that artifact. Snapshot the prior version with a timestamped filename.
3) Re-run the validator for that artifact. Fix until it passes.
4) Propagate forward: regenerate all directly dependent artifacts in order.
5) Record a one-sentence change log, e.g., "Moved D2 from train crash to courtroom ambush; adjusted POV in chs 19–22."


    DEFINITION OF DONE
    ------------------
    You have a 3-field artifact. No field is blank. It reads like a product promise, not a poem.
