Snowflake Step 3 — CHARACTER SUMMARY SHEETS (per major character)
=================================================================
    PURPOSE
    -------
    Create one compact, comparable sheet per major character. Encode goal/values/conflict/epiphany and a micro-arc so POV and scene decisions are grounded.

    REQUIRED FIELDS (USE THESE HEADINGS VERBATIM)
    ---------------------------------------------
    - Role
    - Name
    - Goal (concrete, story-bound)
    - Ambition (abstract life-aim)
    - Values (3× "Nothing is more important than …" sentences)
    - Conflict (who/what opposes the goal)
    - Epiphany (what they learn/change; villains may have "NONE")
    - One-sentence summary (this character’s story in one line)
    - One-paragraph summary (this character’s 3-Act personal arc)

    OUTPUT ARTIFACT
    ---------------
    character_summaries.json — array of character objects with the above fields.

    DO EXACTLY THIS
    ---------------
    1) List principals: protagonist, antagonist, primary allies, love interest, key foils.
    2) Write GOAL as a testable outcome tied to the main plot ("win the grant"; "prove the fraud").
    3) Write AMBITION as the life-aim driving their choices ("security", "recognition", "freedom").
    4) Write three VALUES statements starting with "Nothing is more important than …" Use concrete nouns ("my sister", "keeping promises", "telling the truth").
    5) Write CONFLICT naming the strongest opposing force (person/system/nature) and briefly how it blocks them.
    6) Write EPIPHANY as a single clause. For villains, "none" is acceptable, but explain why.
    7) Write the one-line and one-paragraph personal arc mapping to D1/D2/D3 when relevant.
    8) Cross-check protagonist GOAL collides with antagonist CONFLICT by mid-Act II.

    LITERAL TEMPLATE (COPY/PASTE AND FILL)
    --------------------------------------
    ```
    Role: <e.g., Protagonist>
    Name: <e.g., Ava M.>
    Goal: <external, testable>
    Ambition: <abstract life-aim>
    Values:
      - Nothing is more important than <X>.
      - Nothing is more important than <Y>.
      - Nothing is more important than <Z>.
    Conflict: <who/what blocks and how>
    Epiphany: <lesson / change> (Villain: "none" if appropriate)
    One-sentence summary: <their arc in one line>
    One-paragraph summary: <their 3-Act arc with D1/D2/D3 touchpoints>
    ```

    EXAMPLE NOTES (PARAPHRASED FROM THE BOOK)
    -----------------------------------------
    - The protagonist values competence/control; her epiphany is learning to accept help to win the larger fight.
    - The antagonist is never a cardboard cutout; give them interior logic and a reason you could argue in their favor.

    ACCEPTANCE CHECKS
    -----------------
    - Every principal has every field.
    - Goals are concrete. Ambitions are abstract. Values are literal sentences.
    - Antagonist has interiority; if epiphany is "none", the reason is stated.
    - Personal arcs align with the Step 2 disasters.

    FAILURE MODES → FIXES
    ---------------------
    - Generic values: rewrite as testable sentences.
    - Vague conflict: name a specific person/system/nature force that blocks.
    - Flat antagonist: add motive history that makes their actions inevitable.

    WARNINGS — DO NOT DEVIATE
- Follow the Snowflake order. If a better idea appears later, revise the upstream artifact FIRST, then regenerate downstream artifacts.
- Use plain, literal language in planning artifacts. No flowery prose, no metaphors. Save flourish for Step 10 drafting.
- Fill every required field. If unknown, write BEST-GUESS and mark TODO. Do not leave blanks.
- Never skip the MORAL PREMISE (Step 2) or the CONFLICT requirement (Steps 8–9). These are non-negotiable.


    STANDARD REGENERATION PROTOCOL (ALWAYS THE SAME)
1) Identify smallest upstream artifact that is insufficient or contradictory.
2) Regenerate ONLY that artifact. Snapshot the prior version with a timestamped filename.
3) Re-run the validator for that artifact. Fix until it passes.
4) Propagate forward: regenerate all directly dependent artifacts in order.
5) Record a one-sentence change log, e.g., "Moved D2 from train crash to courtroom ambush; adjusted POV in chs 19–22."


    DONE WHEN
    ---------
    You have a JSON array of complete character sheets. No blank fields.
