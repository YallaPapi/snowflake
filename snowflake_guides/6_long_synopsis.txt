Snowflake Step 6 — LONG SYNOPSIS (~4–5 pages)
=============================================
    PURPOSE
    -------
    Expand each paragraph of the one-page synopsis into about a page while maintaining strict causality.
    This becomes feedstock for the scene list.

    OUTPUT ARTIFACT
    ---------------
    long_synopsis.md — five sections that mirror Step 4 paragraphs.

    DO EXACTLY THIS
    ---------------
    1) Section 1 from Paragraph 1: opening sequence beats, inciting incident, and first concrete step toward the goal.
    2) Section 2 from Paragraph 2: rising complications to a D1 that truly removes retreat (explicit “why no way back”).
    3) Section 3 from Paragraph 3: pressures that culminate in D2; SHOW the belief pivot and a new tactic.
    4) Section 4 from Paragraph 4: compress options until D3, the funnel to endgame.
    5) Section 5 from Paragraph 5: showdown escalations, visible outcome, immediate aftermath.
    6) Replace “and then” with “therefore/but” causality between beats.
    7) Mark any new beat that contradicts earlier steps → pause and revise upstream before continuing.

    ACCEPTANCE CHECKS
    -----------------
    - Five sections map 1:1 to Step 4.
    - Each section is a CAUSAL chain, not vignettes.
    - D1/D2/D3 are bigger, clearer, and are forcing functions.

    FAILURE MODES → FIXES
    ---------------------
    - Coincidence solves a problem: replace with a character decision or antagonist competence.
    - Late twist breaks D2 logic: foreshadow in sections 1–2 or move to sequel.
    - Cast bloat: combine minor roles; keep POVs limited.

    WARNINGS — DO NOT DEVIATE
- Follow the Snowflake order. If a better idea appears later, revise the upstream artifact FIRST, then regenerate downstream artifacts.
- Use plain, literal language in planning artifacts. No flowery prose, no metaphors. Save flourish for Step 10 drafting.
- Fill every required field. If unknown, write BEST-GUESS and mark TODO. Do not leave blanks.
- Never skip the MORAL PREMISE (Step 2) or the CONFLICT requirement (Steps 8–9). These are non-negotiable.


    STANDARD REGENERATION PROTOCOL (ALWAYS THE SAME)
1) Identify smallest upstream artifact that is insufficient or contradictory.
2) Regenerate ONLY that artifact. Snapshot the prior version with a timestamped filename.
3) Re-run the validator for that artifact. Fix until it passes.
4) Propagate forward: regenerate all directly dependent artifacts in order.
5) Record a one-sentence change log, e.g., "Moved D2 from train crash to courtroom ambush; adjusted POV in chs 19–22."


    DONE WHEN
    ---------
    You have ~4–5 pages of inevitable escalation ready to slice into scenes.
