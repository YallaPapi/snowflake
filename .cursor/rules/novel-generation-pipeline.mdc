## Core Pipeline Structure
**Importance Score: 95**

The novel generation pipeline implements the Snowflake Method through 11 ordered steps:

1. Story Market Position (Step 0)
- Validates real bookstore shelf labels
- Enforces trope requirements
- Validates concrete audience satisfiers

2. One-Sentence Summary (Step 1)
- Enforces 25-word maximum
- Validates external testable goal
- Requires implied opposition

3. One-Paragraph Summary (Step 2)
- Mandates exactly 5 sentences
- Requires 3 disasters with forcing functions 
- Validates FALSEâ†’TRUE moral premise

4. Character Development (Step 3)
- Enforces character role requirements
- Validates goal/ambition formatting
- Ensures protagonist-antagonist collision

The remaining steps 4-10 build upon these foundational elements.

## Validation Chain
**Importance Score: 90**

Each step's artifacts undergo multi-level validation:

1. Structural Validation
- Enforces format requirements
- Validates word/sentence counts
- Checks required fields

2. Content Validation  
- Validates tropes against master list
- Ensures concrete vs abstract elements
- Checks causal relationships

3. Cross-Step Validation
- Verifies disaster consistency 
- Validates character arc alignment
- Ensures moral premise integration

## Artifact Dependencies
**Importance Score: 85**

The pipeline maintains strict dependencies between artifacts:

```
Step 0 -> Step 1 -> Step 2 -> Step 3
     \              \         \
      -> Step 4 ------> Step 5 -> Step 6
           \                 \
            -> Step 7 ---------> Step 8 -> Step 9 -> Step 10
```

Changes in upstream artifacts trigger regeneration of dependent downstream elements.
