### Character Development Models
**Importance Score: 95**

1. Character Arc Validation
- Enforces character role requirements and relationships
- Validates alignment between character arcs and story disasters
- Ensures antagonist complexity and moral opposition
- Tracks character value transformations through scenes
File: `src/pipeline/validators/step_3_validator.py`

2. Character Collision Matrix
- Maps required interactions between protagonist/antagonist 
- Validates collision points at key disaster moments
- Ensures moral premise opposition between main characters
File: `src/pipeline/steps/step_3_character_summaries.py`

### Scene Structure Models
**Importance Score: 92**

1. Scene Triad Enforcement
- Validates each scene follows either:
  - Proactive: Goal → Conflict → Setback
  - Reactive: Reaction → Dilemma → Decision
- Ensures proper alternation between proactive/reactive scenes
File: `src/pipeline/validators/step_8_validator.py`

2. Disaster Placement Rules
- Enforces major story disasters at 25%, 50%, and 75% marks
- Validates disaster severity escalation
- Ensures disasters force character value changes
File: `src/pipeline/validators/step_9_validator.py`

### Moral Premise Integration 
**Importance Score: 88**

1. Value Transformation Tracking
- Maps character FALSE→TRUE belief progression
- Validates moral premise testing in disaster scenes
- Ensures protagonist/antagonist value collision
File: `src/pipeline/steps/step_2_one_paragraph_summary.py`

2. Scene-Level Moral Testing
- Validates each scene tests the moral premise
- Tracks incremental value shifts per character
- Ensures moral resolution aligns with character arcs
File: `src/pipeline/validators/step_8_validator.py`
