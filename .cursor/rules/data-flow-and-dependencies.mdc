### Story Artifact Flow Engine
**Importance Score: 95**

Core system for managing story artifact dependencies and versioning:

1. Dependency Chain:
- One-sentence summary → One-paragraph summary → Character summaries → Scene list
- Each downstream artifact depends on validation of upstream artifacts
- `src/pipeline/orchestrator.py` maintains dependency graph
- Story disasters (D1/D2/D3) flow through entire chain

2. Version Control:
- SHA256 hashing tracks changes in story artifacts
- Hash changes trigger downstream regeneration
- Maintains full artifact history with parent/child relationships
- Enables rollback to previous valid states

3. Story Disaster Flow:
- Core disasters defined in one-paragraph summary
- Character arcs aligned with disaster points
- Scene triads build toward disaster moments
- `src/pipeline/validators/step_2_validator.py` enforces disaster structure

4. Moral Premise Propagation:
- FALSE→TRUE belief transformation flows from summary
- Character arcs must demonstrate premise transformation
- Scene conflicts reflect premise tension
- `src/pipeline/validators/step_3_validator.py` validates premise integration

5. Character Relationship Dependencies:
- Protagonist/antagonist collision validation
- Value conflicts mapped across character set
- Goal interference tracking between characters
- Ambition/value alignment validation

### Critical Flow Components
**Importance Score: 90**

1. Market Position Flow:
```
Category → Story Kind → Audience Satisfiers
                    ↓
       Scene Hooks ← Tropes
```

2. Character Development Flow:
```
Goals → Ambitions → Values → Arcs
                          ↓
Scene Conflicts ← Character Collisions
```

3. Story Structure Flow:
```
Premise → Disasters → Character Transformations
                   ↓
         Scene Triads ← Scene Purpose
```
