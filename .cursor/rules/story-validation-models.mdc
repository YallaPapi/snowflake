### Core Validation Rules
**Importance Score: 95**

1. Market Position Validation (`src/pipeline/validators/step_0_validator.py`)
- Enforces real bookstore shelf labels for categories
- Validates trope signals in story kind
- Requires 3-5 concrete audience satisfiers
- Rejects abstract/mood words in favor of testable elements

2. Story Structure Validation (`src/pipeline/validators/step_1_validator.py`, `step_2_validator.py`)
- Logline: Max 25 words, max 2 named characters, external testable goal
- Paragraph Summary: 5 sentences with 3 disasters 
- Forces explicit FALSE→TRUE belief transformation
- Rejects coincidences in favor of causal chains

3. Character Arc Validation (`src/pipeline/validators/step_3_validator.py`)
- Enforces collision between protagonist/antagonist values
- Requires concrete goals vs abstract ambitions
- Maps character transformations to story disasters
- Validates moral premise integration

4. Scene Structure Rules (`src/pipeline/validators/step_8_validator.py`, `step_9_validator.py`)
- Enforces scene triad patterns:
  - Proactive: Goal → Conflict → Setback
  - Reactive: Reaction → Dilemma → Decision
- Validates disaster placement at 25/50/75% marks
- Ensures proper proactive/reactive scene alternation

### Specialized Validation Components

1. Disaster Tracking System (`src/pipeline/validators/disaster_tracker.py`)
**Importance Score: 90**
- Tracks three major story disasters (D1, D2, D3)
- Validates forcing functions for each disaster
- Ensures disasters drive character transformation
- Maps disasters to moral premise progression

2. Character Collision Matrix (`src/pipeline/validators/character_collision.py`) 
**Importance Score: 85**
- Validates value conflicts between characters
- Ensures antagonist directly opposes protagonist goals
- Tracks relationship transformations through disasters
- Validates supporting character alignments

3. Moral Premise Engine (`src/pipeline/validators/moral_premise.py`)
**Importance Score: 85**
- Enforces specific moral premise format
- Tracks FALSE→TRUE belief transformation
- Validates premise integration in character arcs
- Maps premise to disaster chain

4. Causality Validator (`src/pipeline/validators/causality.py`)
**Importance Score: 80**
- Detects and rejects coincidental events
- Enforces cause-effect relationships
- Validates scene-level causality chains
- Ensures proper setup/payoff structure
