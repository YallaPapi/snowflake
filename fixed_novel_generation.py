    In 2087, Maya Chen discovers that her recurring dreams of past lives are actually memories from parallel versions of herself across the multiverse. When a dimensional accident during her neuroscience research allows her to consciously access these alternate selves, she realizes each version made different life choices that led to vastly different outcomes. 

    As Maya learns to navigate between realities, she uncovers a sinister plot by a tech corporation that's harvesting consciousness from infinite versions of people to create an immortality serum for the ultra-wealthy. With help from her alternate selves‚Äîincluding a version who became a brilliant hacker and another who joined the resistance‚ÄîMaya must stop this exploitation before her own consciousness becomes fragmented across infinite realities forever.

    Target audience: Adult readers who enjoy science fiction with philosophical depth
    Genre: Science fiction thriller with psychological and philosophical elements
    Themes: Identity, free will vs. determinism, consciousness, corporate power, resistance

COMPLETE NOVEL GENERATION TASK:
Execute the full Snowflake Method pipeline (Steps 0-10) with all agents collaborating:

1. ConceptMaster: Step 0 - Analyze concept, genre, audience, themes, delight factors
2. StoryArchitect: Step 1 - Create compelling one-sentence logline (max 25 words)  
3. StoryArchitect: Step 2 - Expand to five-sentence paragraph with clear disasters
4. CharacterCreator: Step 3 - Develop main character summaries with goals/conflicts
5. StoryArchitect: Step 4 - Create one-page synopsis expanding each sentence to paragraph
6. CharacterCreator: Step 5 - Write detailed character synopses (especially antagonist)
7. StoryArchitect: Step 6 - Develop four-page long synopsis expanding each paragraph
8. CharacterCreator: Step 7 - Create complete character bibles with full profiles
9. SceneEngine: Step 8 - Generate detailed scene list with POV and conflict markers
10. SceneEngine: Step 9 - Write scene briefs with Goal/Conflict/Setback triads
11. ProseAgent: Step 10 - Write complete first draft chapters from scene briefs
12. EditorAgent: Final quality control and polish

Please work collaboratively, with each agent building on the previous work and ensuring quality gates are met at each step.
