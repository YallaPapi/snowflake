Prose Generation for Reference Scenes

TaskMaster Task 49.3: Generate Prose for Both Scenes
Demonstrates the Scene Engine's ability to convert Scene Cards into prose

This module uses the Scene Drafting Service to generate prose from the
Ingermanson reference scene cards, showing how G-C-S and R-D-D structures
are converted into narrative text.
