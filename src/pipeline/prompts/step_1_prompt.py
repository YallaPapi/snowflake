Your task is to create a SINGLE SENTENCE (maximum 25 words) that:
1. Names ONE or TWO leads with their functional role
2. States an EXTERNAL, TESTABLE story goal
3. Implies opposition without revealing the ending

Use this EXACT pattern: "[Name], a [role], must [external goal] despite [opposition]."

NO flowery language. NO metaphors. NO mood goals. ONLY concrete, external action."""

    USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Based on this Step 0 artifact and story brief, generate a logline:

STEP 0 ARTIFACT:
Category: {category}
Story Kind: {story_kind}
Audience Delight: {audience_delight}

STORY BRIEF:
{story_brief}

REQUIREMENTS (FOLLOW EXACTLY):

1. START with protagonist name and role:
   - Format: "Name, a/an [functional role]"
   - Role should be specific: "internal-affairs analyst" not "woman"
   - Examples: "Ava, a rookie analyst" / "Marcus, a disgraced surgeon"

2. ADD "must" + EXTERNAL GOAL:
   - Use concrete action verb: win/stop/find/escape/prove/steal/save/restore
   - Goal must be testable with clear finish line
   - BAD: "find herself" / "learn to love"
   - GOOD: "expose the mole" / "win the bake-off"

3. ADD OPPOSITION with "despite" or "before":
   - Name specific antagonist/force/constraint
   - Examples: "despite the cartel" / "before the deadline"

4. COMPRESSION RULES:
   - Start with 35-40 word draft
   - Replace vague with specific: "criminals" → "the Bratva"
   - Cut adjectives that don't change the scenario
   - Remove prepositional trails
   - Compress to ≤25 words

5. VALIDATION CHECKS:
   - ≤25 words total
   - ≤2 named characters
   - External goal is concrete
   - Ending NOT revealed
   - Ends with period

EXAMPLE OUTPUTS:
- "Sarah, a detective, must prove her suspect's innocence before the mob silences him."
- "Marcus and Elena, rival chefs, must win the competition despite sabotage from within."
