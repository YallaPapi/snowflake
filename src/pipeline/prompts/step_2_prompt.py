Your task is to create EXACTLY FIVE SENTENCES that establish:

3. DISASTER #2 (drives belief shift - moral pivot)
4. DISASTER #3 (forces endgame)
5. Resolution (showdown + outcome)

NO flowery language. Use plain, literal description. Every disaster must FORCE action."""

STEP 0 ARTIFACT:
Category: {category}
Story Kind: {story_kind}
Audience Delight: {audience_delight}

STEP 1 LOGLINE:

REQUIRED SENTENCE MAP (FOLLOW EXACTLY):

SENTENCE 1 - SETUP:
- Copy lead(s) and goal from logline
- Add concrete setting (time and place)
- Add urgency marker (why NOW)
- Pattern: "In [place], [lead] must [goal] before [deadline/consequence]."

SENTENCE 2 - DISASTER #1 (End of Act I):
- Event that FORCES commitment
- Removes retreat option
- Use "forces" or "leaves no choice"
- Pattern: "When [event], she is forced to [commit] or [dire consequence]."

SENTENCE 3 - DISASTER #2 (End of Act IIa) - MORAL PIVOT:
- Blow that reveals false belief won't work
- Character realizes truth and changes tactics
- EXPLICITLY show the shift
- Pattern: "After [blow], she realizes [false way fails] and must [new approach based on truth]."

SENTENCE 4 - DISASTER #3 (End of Act IIb):
- Event that forces BOTH sides to final confrontation
- No more delays possible
- Pattern: "When [event], both must commit to ending this through [final confrontation]."

SENTENCE 5 - RESOLUTION:
- Showdown type + immediate outcome
- Be concrete: wins/loses/chooses
- Pattern: "In the final [confrontation type], [lead] [concrete outcome]."

MORAL PREMISE (SEPARATE):
Format: "People succeed when they [TRUE BELIEF], and they fail when they [FALSE BELIEF]."

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- EXACTLY 5 sentences in paragraph
- Each disaster uses forcing language
- Sentence 3 MUST show belief shift explicitly
