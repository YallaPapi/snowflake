## Issues and Considerations for User Attention

### ⚠️ Dependency Requirements
The following Python packages need to be installed for full functionality:
```bash
pip install python-docx ebooklib reportlab pydantic sqlalchemy
```

**Action Required:** Add these dependencies to requirements.txt

### ⚠️ AI Model Configuration  
AI model integration requires API keys to be configured:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` for GPT models  
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for Gemini

**Action Required:** Set up environment variables or configuration file

### ⚠️ Database Migration Strategy
Current implementation uses SQLite for development. Production deployment considerations:
- PostgreSQL recommended for multi-user scenarios
- Migration scripts may be needed for existing data
- Connection pooling configuration for high-load environments

**Action Required:** Define production database strategy

### ⚠️ Template Customization
Export templates are currently hardcoded. Consider:
- User-defined template upload capability
- Template versioning and management interface  
- Custom styling options for different output formats

**Action Required:** Design template management UI/API

### ⚠️ Performance Monitoring
System includes comprehensive statistics but lacks:
- Real-time performance dashboards
- Alert thresholds for critical metrics
- Historical performance trend analysis

**Action Required:** Consider monitoring/alerting infrastructure

## Next Steps and Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Install Dependencies**: Add required packages to project requirements
2. **Environment Setup**: Configure AI model API keys
3. **Database Initialize**: Run initial database setup and migrations
4. **Integration Testing**: Execute comprehensive test suite
5. **Documentation Review**: Validate API documentation completeness

### Future Enhancements
1. **UI Development**: Web interface for scene generation and management
2. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user editing capabilities  
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning insights on writing patterns
4. **Plugin System**: Third-party integration framework
5. **Cloud Deployment**: Container deployment and scaling strategies
