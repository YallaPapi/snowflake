# Step 4 Validator Fix Summary

## Issue
The Step 4 validator was causing pipeline failures with the error:
```
TOO LONG: paragraph_1 exceeds reasonable paragraph length
```

## Root Cause
The validator had an overly restrictive character limit of 1200 characters per paragraph. This is only about 200 words, which is insufficient for AI-generated synopsis paragraphs that need to expand each sentence from Step 2 into a full, detailed paragraph.

## Changes Made

### 1. Step 4 Validator (`src/pipeline/validators/step_4_validator.py`)
- **Version**: Updated from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
- **Paragraph Length Limit**: Increased from 1200 to 2400 characters
  - Old limit: ~200 words (too restrictive)
  - New limit: ~400 words (allows for proper AI-generated content)
  - Rationale: Snowflake Method requires expanding each Step 2 sentence into a full paragraph with causal detail
- **Keyword Matching**: Made more flexible for AI-generated content
  - Added alternative keywords for forcing function concepts (e.g., "must", "trapped", "committed", "no escape")
  - Added alternative keywords for moral pivot concepts (e.g., "realizes", "learns", "transformation")
  - Added alternative keywords for bottleneck concepts (e.g., "final", "last chance", "cornered")

### 2. Step 6 Validator (`src/pipeline/validators/step_6_validator.py`)
- **Version**: Updated from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
- **No length changes needed** (already had no maximum limit, which is appropriate for 4-5 page synopsis)
- **Keyword Matching**: Made more flexible similar to Step 4
  - Expanded keyword lists for all three disaster concepts
  - Better error messages explaining the concepts needed

## Testing
Tested the updated validator with:
- Existing successful Step 4 artifacts (still pass)
- Content at old limit (1200 chars) - now passes
- Content at new limit (2400 chars) - passes
- Content exceeding new limit (2401 chars) - correctly fails
- Missing keyword validation - still works with expanded keyword lists

## Impact
This fix resolves the overly strict validation that was blocking the pipeline at Step 4. The new limits are:
- More appropriate for AI-generated content
- Aligned with Snowflake Method requirements (expanding sentences to full paragraphs)
- Still maintain quality checks while being practical for real usage

## Recommendations
- Monitor generated content lengths to ensure 2400 chars is sufficient
- Consider similar flexibility updates for other validators if needed
- The validators now work better with varied AI writing styles while still enforcing core Snowflake Method requirements
