  "long_synopsis": "Internal Affairs Detective Mira Chen sits in her dimly lit office at 3 AM, reviewing bodycam footage for the fifteenth time. The grainy video shows Officer James Hayes approaching seventeen-year-old Marcus Williams on a poorly lit street in the rapidly gentrifying Riverside district. The official report states Williams matched a robbery suspect description and reached for his waistband. But something about the footage doesn't align with Hayes' statement - the camera angle shifts awkwardly just before the crucial moment, and the audio cuts out for two critical seconds before the shots are fired.\n\nMira's phone buzzes with another text from her supervisor, Captain Rivera: 'Community leaders demanding answers. Police union wants this wrapped by Friday.' Five days to determine if this was justified force or murder. She studies Hayes' personnel file again - no prior shootings, multiple commendations for peaceful conflict resolution. The disconnect gnaws at her. At dawn, she visits the scene, noting the new luxury apartments towering over old row houses. A memorial of flowers and protest signs has sprouted where Williams fell. An elderly resident approaches, describing Williams as a 'good kid' who tutored neighborhood children. The growing media presence and mounting community protests force Mira to accelerate her investigation, knowing there's no way back from the path she's about to take.\n\nDuring her first interview with Hayes, Mira sees beyond the standard defensive posture of officers under investigation. Hayes appears genuinely haunted, his hands trembling as he describes that night. 'Something wasn't right,' he confides. 'The call that sent me there - it felt staged.' His words trigger Mira's instincts. Digging deeper, she uncovers a pattern: Hayes had recently reported suspicious activities by fellow officers in Riverside, particularly regarding protection payments from developers. The shooting occurred just days after his report.\n\nFurther interviews reveal Hayes as someone wrestling with the same challenges she faces as a minority officer - trying to serve both the department and a community that often mistrusts police. Their shared experiences create an unexpected connection, complicating her objectivity. The situation reaches a critical point when Hayes is attacked outside his home, the assailants wearing police-issue boots. This forces Mira to choose between maintaining investigative distance or becoming Hayes' only protection against corrupt officers who want him silenced. Her decision to secretly guard him eliminates any possibility of remaining neutral, marking the first disaster in her carefully planned investigation.\n\nThe investigation takes a devastating turn when crucial surveillance footage from a nearby business mysteriously vanishes from evidence. Hours later, her key witness - a store owner who disputed the official timeline - is found dead in his shop, wrists slashed. The department quickly rules it suicide, but Mira recognizes the signature of a cover-up she's seen before but always ignored. This second disaster shatters her professional identity. For fifteen years, she's prided herself on being a 'good cop' who works within the system, believing her mere presence as an Asian-American woman in Internal Affairs somehow proves progress is possible.\n\nStanding in the witness's shop, surrounded by crime scene tape, Mira faces a brutal truth: her careful compliance has made her complicit. Every time she accepted a suspicious ruling, every time she looked away from questionable evidence, she helped maintain the very system she claimed to be changing. This moral revelation forces her to pivot dramatically. She begins building a covert case, using unauthorized surveillance equipment borrowed from a former colleague. She reaches out to community activists she once viewed as adversaries, particularly Sarah Martinez, who has documented similar patterns of suspicious incidents in Riverside.\n\nThe investigation's scope expands as Mira and Sarah uncover a web of corruption centered around Lieutenant Victor Reeves, a twenty-year veteran who controls patrol assignments in Riverside. Evidence suggests Reeves orchestrates 'incidents' to pressure holdout property owners into selling to developers. But before Mira can secure proof, her office is ransacked and her confidential files disappear. Her supervisor issues an ultimatum: close the Hayes case within 24 hours or face reassignment.\n\nWith official channels compromised, Mira's only remaining allies are Sarah and Officer Jessica Torres, a rookie who's been quietly tracking similar patterns in dispatch records. The situation reaches its breaking point when Reeves approaches Mira in the department parking garage. His threat is clear: her elderly parents' small restaurant could suffer an unfortunate 'electrical fire.' Hours later, Hayes is framed for shooting a developer's security guard, eliminating all retreat options. The only path forward is a dangerous sting operation targeting Reeves and his crew before they can silence Hayes permanently.\n\nWorking against the clock, Mira orchestrates a public forum on police accountability, leaking word that Hayes will reveal everything he knows. As expected, Reeves and his officers attempt to shut down the meeting by force. But Mira has prepared - every attendee wears a hidden camera, streaming live to multiple secure servers. When Reeves's team draws weapons, their actions are captured from dozens of angles, confirming the pattern of intimidation and violence.\n\nThe resulting chaos validates Mira's entire investigation as Reeves's mask finally slips. In front of hundreds of witnesses and cameras, he reveals the depth of his corruption, believing he's still untouchable. The footage becomes undeniable evidence, leading to multiple arrests and launching a federal investigation into developer connections to the department.\n\nIn the aftermath, Hayes is cleared of wrongdoing, though he chooses to leave the force to work with community organizations. The conspiracy's exposure catalyzes long-overdue reforms, with Mira reluctantly becoming a spokesperson for police accountability. Though she can no longer work in Internal Affairs, she finds unexpected fulfillment training a new generation of officers alongside community leaders, teaching them to recognize and resist systemic corruption. Her career path has fundamentally changed, but she's finally at peace, having chosen justice over institutional loyalty. The case that threatened to end her career instead gave her the clarity to redefine what it means to truly protect and serve.",
